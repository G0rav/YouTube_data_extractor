The harvest is the end of the age, and the reapers are angels. Just as the weeds are gathered and burned with fire, so will it be at the end of the age. The Son of Man will send his angels, and they will gather out of his kingdom all causes of sin and all law-breakers, and throw them into the fiery furnace.

(⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️)
 This was god damn amazing the beginning of this match was great the middle of it was awesome hell that end was just plain awesome I was Cedric got illuminated  was holy shit crazy and I almost  thought that  Dolph won  and I won’t spoil it happens after the match but oh my god that was crazy  || Chilly Willy - THe show opener as an a bomb; I like the part where dolly got speared through the glass. I also think you did a good job on dolph interfearing with punk. But I think it would’ve been cool if punk returned with bolt cutters to ruin dolphs chances on winning and stealing the championship for himself. The KO and Murphy match I really enjoyed because, of the unique backstage area, With the scaffolding, that area where Murphy climbed up to, and the can that Murphy was thrown onto. But when’s KO went for a frog splash on Murphy. The way the can was dented would’ve made KOs knees and upper chest hit the edges. Then, I liked the run in by Kane and Braun, I also really liked that face mask the Braun wore. Then in the 2nd chamber I wished Kenny didn’t retain his championship because then 2/2 chambers ended up not doing anything except fo giving us one hell of matches. I though it would’ve been cool if Adam Cole made a sort of friendship with the Wyatt cult, not like him joining the cult, just kinda of them being connected in some way. I’m very surprised there were only 4 matches, even if the were all above 30 min. Long. Overall the best POV you have put on except for 2 or 3 mishaps here and there. || Videntures 27 - Contains spoilers  || CoreyyH - What a show seths attire was amazing and balor and balor club has arrived and returned you killed it !!! || OOF Wagon - 9:10

It was great and when

The booking was amazing, the matches were amazing, the recording was amazing, and the commentary was amazing. Glad you took your time with this so we could get the best of what could come out. Can't wait for MyDamnNation. Amazing ending to the show with the return of Finn Balor and the Balor Club. || TheMemever Guy - This show was a 10/10, my first show and holy cow.

There are two correct options
Both NO- and MeCH 2- can act as the 4 electron donor ligands as the bridging ligands. H- and CO both can act as the 2 electron donor as the bridging ligand. For NO- the 2 lone pairs on the sp2 nitrogen are used for bridging the metal centers. For H- 3c-2e Ru-H-Ru bridge bond occurs. Thus the correct ans are NO- and H- and MeCH 2- and CO to satisfy the 18 e rule. But the published ans key only gives 1 option (C) MeCH 2- and CO.

I spent 40 years collapsing one within with so many characters and the victim can go into great depression without full recovery and detachments.of course different hierarchical scripts determines the environment and how much and how difficult to destroy it. The victims are often humiliated and battled for a jumber of years and your mental strength to get through the shame and embarrassment facing within 3 D  public often attracts people talking about u. U can either get into a retaliation mode and absolve into those culture or u can go into hangman mode and start using your intuition of what to do next.

Sir is not going to cut off his youtube time, means he will regularly post videos as he do now, so there is no loss for YouTube watching students.

Thank you Bill Gates! Global cooperation is needed all the time, especially right now. || Thom Pitman - Yes, We (the USA) had not brought into DNA testing ie: PCR Testing because the medical industry does not want quick diagnosis of illness if it interferes with making money from treatment of symptoms.   In other words:   if PCR DNA ASSEY were widely used,   your primary care physician would have knowledge of what is causing your symptoms ie: ameoba infection.

But there is corruption and shady/evil practices happening throughout the entire world. It’s amazing how people are willfully ignorant. They’d rather believe a baseless internet theory than accept the actual wrongs that exist in the world, just so they can prop up their own beliefs. So many people are living in active cognitive dissonance… if this trend continues then the divide will only grow (which is what those who seek to undermine democracy want) and then the true evil will seed itself in the form of authoritarianism. Once that happens you’ll all plead with the heavens to save you and return your rights but by then it will be too late. Please genuinely educate yourselves instead of staying locked inside your digital echo chambers, it’s the only chance we have. We have to be united as humans, we cannot allow them to divide us. || Pandurang Gireesh - This virus has shown human kind the repercussions of not paying attention to their health system or routine || Shinji Kanamaru - They'll cut you off when you're typing your comment.

The ability of the virus to mutate will also determine lasting effects. The efficiency at which it spreads is unprecedented. Evidence exists to suggest that viruses are responsible for a significant number of evolutionary modifications (in DNA) amongst a variety of species, resulting in their success, and the ever changing diversity observed today. The Earth is certainly over populated by humans. The lack of reproductive control humans (and other creatures) exhibit in regard to their population warrants action naturally and artificially. Adoption of the hive mind, education, and a sense of unity could finally erase the lines that divide country and race. || Wei Ann Tan - Bill gates should run for presidency || Ryan Palmer - I honestly do not think the virus will teach us how to make a version of Windows that still works after getting updates. || Jaco Dvo - 1:14 ""...the toll was greater than I expected..."" || Daniel Toma - Bill Gates is an evil form of life with absolutely no love. || House Plant - To all Americans starting about the ""chip"" : If they wanted they can track with your phone already. || Bree e - Since when is he a viable medical reference?

Let's just invade third world countries with oil. || GVSH - mr. Gates associated himself with Epstein even after he was convicted || Kane San Miguel - Y'know, if Bill Gates would have died sometime before this pandemic, he'd be seen as a ""truther"" or a visionary that we should have listened to. But, he's alive and well. Plus, he's a billionaire. So that automatically means he's the mastermind and ultimate profiteer of all this. || Dzbigor TV - M U R D E R || Bob Silver - Mr. Vaccine himself || jamie turnage - hes mad scientist nerd || Isabella Faria - a shame that I wasn´t able to watch the video, the ad was 3:56 long and I couldn´t skip it

Thanks Dr. Gates..... || Melissa - Event 201 || Khloe smash subs - You LOSE || Justin Spell - God help us!!!!! || tr3vk4m - Everyone in the world should go on strike. Refuse to work for unfair pay. Refuse to work in dangerous conditions or to do work that harms others. || Tom Delay Beats - When did Bill Gates become a doctor again? || Keshav Likhar - This guy looks rich!! || Efeler Taburu - Since this guy had been enough rich life off world. does he going to use vaccines that  he's going to find or his going to selling vaccines to poor or unwanted country by he's thought to bring down human populations by %15? || Zevi Kramer - Bill's IQ is 160. Mine is maybe 100. 
I look around and see: handling of the virus correlates with having one healthcare system. We have thousands here and every town mayor is king and choose the actions of his administration.

Are you deleting fox. || DarthRaider - This is why people like Steve jobs and Apple better || R. Win - Well, if anything, Bill could show his good intentions by helping the world to reach an CO2 free society after this pandemic is handled almost immediately. There is only one way: Thorium MSR (Molten Salt Reactor) nuclear energy powering whatever electrical appliances we may have (cars in particular). Thorium is a 50 year old proven technology, inherently SAFE (as opposed to the old Uranium nuclear plants), with a minimum of radioactive waste (with only a half-life time of 300 years as opposed to 150.000 years for uranium isotopes). and can even run on nuclear waste of our old uranium reactors. The only downside? It's waste material has such low residual radioactivity that governments cannot make nuclear weapons of it...Believe it or not but THAT is the only reason why decades ago uranium was chosen over thorium for nuclear energy....There is abundant Thorium , enough to power the planet for the coming 3000 years. So Bill, if you truly want to commit to getting clean energy and prosperity, forget solar, and wind and donate a fraction to THORIUM. It is there and it is proven, unlike fusion... || Jon Cina - You know what, bill gates plan to find Al-Mahdi is totally failed. || 0 0 - We dont care about what Bill Gates has to say. || Jian Li - Understand hospital is not funny. We all tired live with ghosts during a plague what hospital feels like. || Randomz1000 - Honestly, I have no clue why this video was disliked so hard. || Quick RobloxDev - Wuhan health organization || superblonde - GATES could not even fix bugs in MS-Windows now ppl wanna listen to him claim he can fix real life global bugs in Medical biotech ??     pfffff   only thing Gates is good at is creating near-illegal monopolies ... || Julio B. Figueroa - Testing (again) || Doctor Joby - 10s of thousands of people have clicked on this video to give it a downvote. || SoCal 808 - Why is this man talking about our health??? || David Broadway - Yeah... I'm still not convinced that that the coronavirus was not a product of a person like Bill Gates trying to push for one-world power agendas or other political ideology. || Stephanie Whitehouse - Love each other for sure and REMAIN FREE and INDIVIDUAL and DIVERSE because ONE rule is very dangerous especially one that wants control over you . NO 5G say NO TO VACCINES say NO to BILL GATES . || ham - who cares what bill gates says? why give these people power || Edwin Iglesias - Bill Gates is the devil Eugenics through vaccination what a clever way to full society and governments are in bed with him and the CCP. He's not a scientist or doctor to be getting involved in the creation of vaccinations he is an investor and a technology guy. || Zelja Kis - Evil! || Jack Cameron - We learned people do not trust Bill Gates and his Foundation. || hANdsOme seaN - His dad was head of planned Parenthood. Nothing to see here. || OG Albo - Down with the New World Order!! You will NOT win at the end as it is written! || JULALAINE'S FOOTSTEP - Why does he move like that?

Is there something fishy going on.... || BlackAlpha - The worse people always comes out to the top. (Not saying Bill Gates or any other politician is bad. I never said anything like that.) Now we all see the backlash of bad management inexperience corruption lack of backup plans and bad leadership || lolcup - Not Bill Gates: 

Hope we learn from windows 10 || TheGag Attack - Thank you, Bill gates for educating us on coronavirus. || hoang thao truong nguyen - South Korea has dozens of thousands infected and death cases, The figure of Taiwan reaches hundreds of cases and few confirmed deaths and... The West says they are doing fairly well in containing the virus. Vietnam records less than 350 cases without anyone losing their life and yet not many Western press mention about that lol || WhoCares - Can someone explain to me what does one of the richest people in the world, former CEO of Microsoft (technology company which makes Operating System) has to do with vaccines, and pandemic and viruses?!?!?! 
He is not the only one donating money to a great cause, there are others... but I wonder, what does REALLY qualify him to talk about this!?!?!?  || HOLY BLOOD OF JESUS CHRIST - JESUS CHRIST || Rani Rich - We've seen your play book Gates, now we're calling for justice! You and yours should have to take all the vaccines you've planned for us! || adam - What an inspiring video of philanthropy? Reducing the world population by 10 to 15% and empoverishing the population so they accept the vaccine is such a noble task. I love Bill Gates, he is such a selfless person and is just doing what is best for everyone with his 10 billion dollar investment into the covid19 vaccine. Stay Safe and Save Lives!!! If only we had more humanity loving people like Bill Gates to reduce the population further and to track and trace all our movements || Davide Schiatti - At the start mafia try to hide its presence in society and cover up all its business. They did the best job. But 
when buscetta explained what mafia was..mafia start to loose because people started to understand and did something..the law did the rest. Nwo or b.gates maybe were in bad situation..showing their plan to people on the net allowed us to understand their tricks. This is their mistakes...working in the dark were the best choice but maybe problem or hungry of power push them to this big mistake..they are now under the sunlight...we can see them now..we can hit them now! || Nizar Rrisouli - Hhh thats ur story bill Bill Gat  all the time ... speaking only to suport ur self . . . || ivannnn04 - New order devil world || Storm Trooper - that was the first video i thought of when corona hit || Goran Kovacic - Don't delite negative comments || Ëd Balboa - He hopes for globalization and greater monopoly,,,  '-' || FIRE ANGEL - Geek Gates always talking death... || Alex Joslin - So many conspiracy theories against this man. || Tej Amit Srivastava - Bill Gates: My lifetime is a big epidemic.
Introverts: This is why I stay at home and quarantine my whole life. || Mango Tree - 🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮 || Hany Neya - Covid-19 is conspiracy to sell vaccine. || Александр Аммосов - Woow, I’ve just read like 20 or so of new comments and conspiracy is really almost in every second one. And it’s not really Americans that write all of that. Conspiracy hysteria around Gates is from all over the world, from Indonesia to Canada. People are really scared and confused, which is in itself worrisome. But apparently after huge revival of identity politics topic in both developed and developing countries, there would be a loud return of class politics in 20s. Only time will tell us how it will have gone || Kimberlagio - I hope Bill Gates learns to pay taxes :) || King Slushie101 - “W.I.C.K.E.D. is good” || Timothy Bryan - Just because you are richer and want to control things does not mean you tell how I should live. Yes you are a smart man in your field of work BUT you not the ultimate brain in all things. || Kevin Cui - Bill seems like a wise man with smart ideas. He should consider doing a TED talk! || 100% german - trust bill he NEVER said he wants to reduce the population by using vaccines and “reproductive health services” (baby murder and contraception). he also WAS NOT born into a banking family with family in the fed. || Avery Talks About Stuff - It's really eerie to listen to that clip of him predicting a pandemic now. || Babassen Mohamed - Bill gates is a good person he is not interested in money be cause he is reach enough since he created his fondation. || Matt - Media: BELIEVE THE SCIENCE!!! LISTEN TO THE DATA!!! CORONAVIRUS EQUALS DEATH!!!
Also Media: Gives Bill Gates constant airtime, and censors/bans any Medical Doctor or Scientist whose data offers any reassurance about the 99%+ recovery rate of covid patients. || Jian Li - It was not just cold war people died in Vietnam. || Gopinath Sahoo - Ohh Great, now even Bill gates recognises 'Taiwan' as a country. 😁 || Curt Kautsch - The last time Bill Gates talked about a virus was Windows 98 || Marvin Mendez - So you had Bill Gates for interview and you used under 4 minutes of content! I want to know everything he said and not out of context || Marie Mcleod - Sounds like a good man || Syu Qri - He already warn us , but we refuse to listen , || Mzwandile Mpunzi - This is Ludacris!! So now the world must listen to this 👹 || Stereo Gum - Where the minority of humans live!! Let that be felt please! || kartik adhia - Step 1 : Make lots and Lots of money
Step 2: Use tax havens to evade tax on the money.
Step 3 : Lobby the govt. to reduce taxes for the rich and to provide tax concessions for IT research.
Step 4 : The public organisations like govt. healtcare and WHO are left poor and in want of funds. || arris one - Roosevelt died. Move along || Rahman Rahmani - Unfortunately, we all have very short memories. You had predicted this pandemic in 2015 in a conference and nobody had listened to you as well as many thoughts you are mad. Now we pay the price for our ignorance. God bless you and your family for all your humanitarian work around the globe! Get the global leaders to be educated to be aware of the next pandemic COVID-20 which may very likely to come from the same place as COVID-19! || Withy Octopus - Do you want to be depressed? Turn the comments to ""newest"". That's where the horror begins. || Rick-e - bill gates is not bill gates without his pink shirt || Aaron Cipriano - Not honest || Lenovo Telefon - Domnilor cred ca aceasta criza numita Covid-19 este motivul justificat de a vaccina toata populatia globului . Se doreste ca sa se activeze infrastructura 5G , in care sa fie conectati si oamenii prin trupurile lor , astfel : in vaccin va exista o substanta care are rol de a putea fi detectata de catre antenele 5G . Astfel internetul lucrurilor cuprinde si fiintele umane , substanta din vaccinuri avand rolul de substanta de contrast pentru antenele 5G . Astfel oamenii vor fi detectati si localizati oriunde || Canyon Bruar - The only thing our world population is sick from? Gluttony. || Ghavsykd65 H - 0:28 This is a filipino word for Thank You.

Now it is no Bill gates and what not. || Onshore - Where did this conspiracy theory come from where Bill Gates is trying to plant microchips in people? Where’s the proof haha || Robin Car - Gates can’t even save his own computer from a virus! He is a nefarious evildoer! Covers up epidemics started, with his vaccines! || Wendy T. - 👎👎 Gates 🚫💉☠️ ! ! || Jeremy - Can one of you conspiracy theorists actually tell me what the problem with Bill Gates is? || Jeremy Podgursky - what does it say about us that we listen to this guy? He should just shut up and donate, but methinks his ego is too involved. It seems to me that there is a missing step in our rallying cry against the current pandemic. ""Testing and tracing"" are just the first part. What about treating? Why is there not a stronger push towards a therapeutic? Why are we gambling on a vaccine when we can use monoclonal antibodies as a prophylactic and a treatment? ""Duh, look! We've found people who have this virus and the people they have been around.  I guess our job is done!"". Seems to me that there is too much red tape involved in getting sick people the medicine that they need. Or too many thieves trying to make sure that the cure is profitable enough for them. || Sabaudin Tarik - GATES wants to vaccinate everyone else, but NOT HIS OWN CHILDREN
Why not ❓ || The Warrior Mindset - Such a ""nice"" liberal || AsianTheDomination - He's such a generous man who hides all his money in off shore accounts || Sofian Safri - i wonder what MJ would comment if he was alive || K monk - Lol, almost as many down as up votes! || sigmund grizli - That he is still super rich and we are not. || gerva 02 - to be completely honest it breaks my heart seeing so much hate directed to the man who predicted this could have happened || David - Microsoft Windows has always had backdoors, as his vaccines will. NWO. || Khaos - 0:27 haha I like tubig || Lost Hero - Bill Gates: Talks about hope, charity, science, and kindness.
Comments: Talks about conspiracy, hate, envy and despite. || Ishaan Vashist Vlogs - How are you all doing? Tell me in the comments || Liberté De pensée - We have learned that he is doing business and win money via stock exchange finance and vaccines and he didn't care of the health of people.

We have learned also that this virus is made by human in laboratory for big Pharma interests. || Radical Altruist - My comment was deleted, YOU ONLY PROVE YOURSELVES TO BE LIARS, THE ONLY VICTIM OF CORRUPTION AND DISHONESTY IS TRUTH. || Alexandre Wragg Freitas - ""What I hope people will learn about magnates and philanthropists and the whole economic system, with our without coronavirus"" - that would be a bit more interesting. || Blaze-z - He lies he help create the virus just to.

Classic. || Ed Phillips - Why would anyone want Bill Gates’ opinions? || Veer K - but what about the crises that don't slap the world in the face-instead slowly destroy the world?
e.g. climate change, economic divide, etc. || Holy Lotus - bill gates is a eugenicist, dont trust his ""new vaccine"" || Salvador Bonita - whats his name again: eBHELL ? || Passing Through - Thank you Bill Gates...


For making me realise how important it is to listen to myself, my own intuition, my own body and to exercise my Choice Muscle even more. I have the ability to ACCEPT, REJECT, NEGLECT anything you say and guess which one I am going to decide to choose. || Nedello - Guys be careful of 5g || QTR - Why does bill focus on things like this? This pandemic is a thing which will soon go away, why can’t we focus more on the poor who can’t get a job because of ismply being born poor. As said by many, “the rich are getting richer, and the poor are getting poorer”. I WHICH COMMUNISM WORKED.

Bill Gate || Blue Sky - How did he know this virus 🦠 5 years ago? || Volkan Ckc - We dont need you || thatone gingerguy - oooh lots of jokes about spicy comments but no actual comments to be found. Guess I gotta do it then :) Bill used the people in developing countries as guinea pigs to test his vaccines. Bill gates made a deal with the government on contact tracking 2 months before the corona virus hit. Bill gates wants to blot out the sun. || Afshan Raza - Wherever this man goes he just wants to talk about vaccine. || Muddy Digger - Who cares what gates thinks?! || Fat Basterd - The music is VEEERY distracting || Michael Riley - Bill your head will be on a stick soon || LuckyM - The world doesn't need that people are rich like Bill Gates. A single person should not be so powerful . This world doesn't need that hedge fund like blackrock control almost all global economy influencing entire nation's politics and no one is able to truly protest to end this .capitalism is not compatible with democracy. should be eradicated and put limit to personal wealth.

Scam! || Morris Greg - Gill Bates || Ben Neuner - hey bill, i have a question, what do you think of NTDs and how you think we could completely eradicate them? Like 0 NTD cases a year? || Suub City - Bill warns everyone of the inevitability of a pandemic (there have been many before and there will be many in the future.) THEN... 5 years later conspiracy theorists say ""Bill just wants to sell vaccines to everyone"" BUT... If people had just listened to Bill's advice the world would need way less vaccines.

Africa—a CONTINENT (fun fact, Americans!) with over 50 countries—has not experienced anything as unprecedented as this. But guess which place gets dehumanized in the latter part of this video? Africa. You carefully (and excellently) depicted America's plight without dehumanizing anybody in this video. The usual depiction of Africa in Western media is exhausting and feeds into some dangerous stereotypes that your media outlet claims to fight. The Vox I know represents nuanced conversation and fair, transparent reporting. You are not on brand here. || Rolla Kosta - Corbett report, folks - see the truth behind this man || TheDieselbutterfly - This man is working hard for lucifer || Ratna Dahal - Americans need to grow up and learn to differentiate between genius and fool.

I came here for the comments. I learn more from that than Bill gates who could not do any good in the last 10 years, invested 5 billion and gained 10 billion, and now after reading the comments I can tell what other people gain from Bill gates investments. It is said the 5 billion only could do this much for the public health, but it is good for Bill gates because this last 10 years did a lot for him, especially $. || Kychelle Cash - All we need is God || Mike F - I learned that a college dropout that stole copyright software plans can create a monopoly. Then declare himself a doctor and scientist and people will listen.

Bill gates is to medicine what Kanye west is to fashion. || Courtland Stavley - Anybody else hearing the Joker when this video got “suggested”? 
“And here we go....” || Simon Greenshpan - Mr. Gates global vision is a mess. I'd give him a hint to discover that pandemics is a new normal when global population is raising to 8 Billion. Please, give humankind a time to contemplate best possible remedies. || Jian Li - That's why trump is right about Obamacare understand don't overwork the hospital. That's why we have outpatient. Don't go to hospital unless you're life on the line. ||  - The New World Order is coming || Gaming News - Bill gates warned us and said that there would be another outbreak a few years ago. It sounds like he knew that the coronavirus would happen in 2020. Which tells me that he probably helped create the coronavirus. || Vasudev M - We should learn how to install antivirus. || Remy Dao - We need to be consciousness and we will understand.. || Jose A - An Italian congresswoman blamed this man for the epidemic... coincidence? || jorge pearl - when the bird flu I got scared, hoarded food and finished my bunker, the bird flu never jumped from human to human, until now, when this coronavirus was only in China I got scared too, what scared me the most was that most people thought it was like the flu, it is 576 times more deadly || Xavier Pithon - Bill , do you realy make this virus ?

It must mean he is right about everything. || Pedro Saldana - Is he a doctor or something || Dave The Hammer - I see he doesn’t mention that he funds the lab that created this virus in Wuhan China...I never trusted this dude. Very sneaky.. || SCUMPxxxx - Its scary how many conspiracy nuts there are. People should be educated on how to use the internet and how to fact check in school.

The ability to micromanage the daily lives of a populace controlled by fear has been the dream of government types for centuries , & a pandemic is the perfect chance to implement this on the population. This has been so successful that we're sure to see more pandemics caused by government research labs ""accidentally"" releasing all kinds of ills on the public. The question is how long this type of control will be effective as governments repeatedly cry wolf at every opportunity. Bill Gates & other social control advocates are busily collating data on this , even as people suffer physically & economically under this abuse. A weakened economy caused by govt. shutdown of economic transaction produces a  weakened  people that much closer to the serfdom desired by totalitarians the world over. || See A. - Gates was banking on a pandemic! || dBlackHeart - humans never learn, takes a fckin calamity to get us all on d same page............maybe we deserve this || thatfoo - This foo wants the chip in you guys || Thomas A - I can't wait to have Bill's permanent scannable mark on my arm with my next vaccination.

Most people are alarmed at the 60606 at the end for obvious reasons. But I believe it is much more than that. KJV - number of the beast - six hundred, three score and six A Score is 20. Notice you can also see 3, 20s(one is read backwards)in the patent. Notice you can also see 600(reading backwards). And of course you can see 6. There’s still one 6 left over I believe that’s because it’s the number of a man. So we actually have 600, 20, 20, 2O, 6 in the patent.

Maybe this country could have free university education and good health care for everyone if these absurdly wealthy people were brought back into living with everyone else.

Why because he doesn't want too and because he wants to stay rich and only him rich and keep the poor, poor so the rich have working class also known as the middle class, lower middle class and the impoverished.

First it was china, then when that was refuted yall choose a new target and had to come up with the wackiest ideas to support it; ""Microscopic robots injected with the vaccine""? That's absurd. Fact is that we are able to make viruses that are alot more deadly and if you wanted to have a bigger reach and impact you would go for something like 10-15% mortality across the board, but it would be far too easy to identify an artificial virus than a natural one. We have been blessed not to live with serious outbreaks like we had before when vaccines didnt exist, with antibiotic resistant bacteria returning we will start to see more pandemics like this... || John BoBo - This is Satan's son || Lara Lashus - I love him so very much || Robert Garrett - I’m hopeful he’ll shut TFU. || tubularguynine - I learned that Bill's dad was one of the founders of Planned Parenthood and a life-long (still alive) eugenicist and depopulation advocate...and the apple doesn't fall far from the tree. || Dave davidson - He is also the person who wants to put micro chips in people with the Code 6 6 and another six not gonna put it || Jaya Morris - cause he has enough money to just straight up fund the research for a vaccine || Nashier Sirajan - Say whatever you want i love gates he help a lot and lots. || Ianda Cibro - Last thing I heard about what places got hit hardest were the same as where that new 5G data got released || GOD & COUNTRY USA - Yeah one you created, patented and released.

This is human playing with dangerous viruses 🦠 u know exactly what’s happening!!! U all know what time it is!!!! || razorsharpbt - Who elected this clown? || Ngân Trần Thị Thảo - I don't understand why there are so much hate against this interview. Bill Gates just shared his opinions. Why not listen first then share your own opinions, not judments full of hatred. || LiontamerOWA - I hope people have learned how billionaires like him can literally and almost directly solve so many of the world's problems that are being exacerbated right now such as hunger, homelessness, lack of PPE, lack of funding for other essential services such as first responders, medical workers, social programs, etc. but don't because they don't want to have a wealth tax and would rather keep their wealth stored offshore in tax havens like Panama || Alexandria's Expressions Vlogs - We have not established unity, equality and fairness among all Americans in the “United” States of America. Until that happens people will not be able to embrace togetherness throughout the world. It needs to start at home first in every country.

This is like interviewing Freddy Krueger about healing stab wounds 🔪 . He even dresses like him 😒 He has single handedly given the word “philanthropist” a new meaning. It now means “vaccine serial killer” || Scythe ツ - look at all of these wOkE clowns in the comments.

Just wait. || Stu Sargent - Heard any more about the crimes against humanity case in India? Is the India government suing Gates for giving polio to 250K children? || Rush Limbully - Let’s see the doctors and Scientists all excitingly raise their hands to try the first batch of vaccines... after all they are the “scientists” || Adam Kapraun - No tracking. Period. Nice try in your part in causing all this though. ;) if anyone believes Bill Gates had a part to play in this, then join me in reporting bill gate’s videos on grounds of terrorism! || lil bubs - That he is the devil || Jizel Colley - We are not taking your Bule-chip  vaccine || Daniel Duvanå - It's sad to see all the conspiracy theories surrounding Bill Gates and the Coronavirus...

The word ""sinister"" comes to mind. || Drew Andino - Bill Gates gets turned on when he hears Vaccines || Robert Thompson - Bill you need to show not the number of COVID cases but the Death rate per case...and be sure that the deaths are actually from COVID, not just people that would have died had they contracted the FLU or some other similar disease that aggravated a preexisting condition. You really seem smugly content about the fear that you and you fellows have instilled in the average man on the street. || jcs123 - Can you please run for president? || Jim Smith - Bill claimed he gets a 20 to 1 payback on producing killer vaccines. He needs to take the vaccine first and vaccinate his ""wife"" and daughters. || reynadiana0421 - Came here for the comments and they did not disappoint..restores my hope in humanity || dumaramutsi - ""Nothing in the world is more dangerous than sincere ignorance and conscientious stupidity.” MLK
If you want to know WHY the world is suffering this pandemic and WHY (we ) The World deserved it? Just take a look at the comments. || Nick Guariglia - Bill Gates has a stranger past than you have been led to believe over the years. His foundation should be audited by an independent authority. || AnimeEpicAdventure - hes everything that described the anti christ || Cipher Crypto - Bill Gates is the anti-Christ, but I guess that's common knowledge by now. || Roblox Sisters - Wait didn’t bill gates create the virus for money or something. And the vaccine had really bad stuff in it and killed a lot of people. And didn’t he want to make the vaccine mandatory so he gets money. :/ || Nick Lance - We learned you're corrupt. || chris roio - What have I learned from this virus?

No other individual has done as much to save human lives. It’s tragic to see so many people here in the comments falling for conspiracy theories that demonize him. || Jesse Richards - Thats a nice box of relief supplies your village really needs, better hold it up for the camera so we can all see your desperation || Jedidiah Apphus Malak - Hey, how about you fix the viruses on computers!! || Kali Celia - His playing the good guy with a solution after creating the Plandemic. Reptilian! || Billy the kid - I'm soooooo glad this counterfeit computer guy helped me through COVID,  I can't wait to take his digital vaccine so daddy can track everything I do because I'm such a naughty little boy || Jonathan Smith - Don't trust that fool one bit. || Rose Adjei - Such a wicked man || wmaass88 - BG searching for meaning in life.

Go away Bill... || Arbeit Macht frei - I love how many people in the comments knows bill very personally || Nasir Mason - So we’re not gonna talk about how his wife went on tv with a upside down cross on || kpobje - vox, you thought a video about a known eugenist speaking about a virus with tens of conspiracy theories already attached to it would be positively received? You are ADORABLE."

If a rich person fears for his children's future, then there is trouble coming...So, Cooper should have asked, what prompted Gates to say that comment originally. || D L - to your question - I believe big part of the US being worse off (in spite of your resources) is because of mindset, an overly narrow interpretation of the concept of freedom and the illusion that a social society is contradictory with individual 'success' and 'interest' ... that together with cultivated overconfidence, widespread poor education, social inequality and restricted world awareness ... || sistaschin - Who asked Bill what he thinks and who appointed him to make health decisions for us? || Mr.Badluck - Bill gates didn't predicted. More like planned || oskar oskarssson - These interviews are is directed. Coopoer give no sharp questions, He act like he is soooo serious even though he already know the answers. || Michigan USA/Singapore S.E.Asia - He has an investment in the vaccine industry.

He belongs to jail not to Ted Talk || Star Star - How the hell can a person predict shit like this? || Mật Ngọt - He saw its coming  years ago cuz he planned this whole CCP virus.

That you are introducing vaccine to the world || Lamar Jordan - Why is he talking and I’m getting nothing out of it?

That's when all of the ""conspiracy theorists"" say they're going to send us back into lockdown and say that it's because we wanted to get a haircut. Blaming us for the nonexistent ""second wave"". || Jeanine Sanchez - ""Predicted"" || Chloe Bothma - I have to wonder why YouTube recommends cnn to me. Dat's Amazin || Estelita Elefante - All are lies this antichrist || Johnny Oldskool - Yeah let’s believe someone who’s in the 1% elite club of the world who has absolutely no qualifications in medical ethics and CNN the most biased and corrupt propaganda machine news outlet that has ever graced planet earth  ... || Carmen Landeros - This was man-made and you know it to thousand 19 that’s when it was decided that it was gonna be done class mr. bill gates! || Jeanne d'Arc - He is not a medical expert, he is expert for computer virus, what should I think about all this ⁉️🤨 || Vee Ly - He been knew about it because he had his dirty hands in it. || Midas. Gold - bro who raised hand when he said i listened to you! stanning to hard || Mensura Beautiful - Dear god help us all !! || Joyce Bandele - Who’s the doctor here, I’m confused. || Rodrigo Dutardo - Predicted or caused it?


But the real story is that while polio has statistically disappeared from India, there has been a huge spike in cases of non-polio acute flaccid paralysis (NPAFP)– the very types of crippling problems it was hoped would disappear with polio but which have instead flourished from a new cause. || charles hughes - This is biological warfare. || John Madsen - With all his resources and he did nothing. He is a terrible person. Or more likely, his very very general ted talk was absolutely not a prediction. 
Because if he really did know the future.... evil evil person does nothing with his massive resources. || Marie - ""The health experts including myself??""....since when did Bill Gates become a health expert? || Denise Alex - All of them need to be in jail for Treason!!!!!!

Lmao ohh Bill you got something coming for you. || Shah Shah - Omg not one comment in Bill’s favour || master ninja - Wave 2 will have a 20%+ mortality rate so that all of us dissenters will “wise up” and finally take the vaccine.

I bought organic seeds. || Cory Rich - I feel Iike he’s laughing/smiling  at the public’s response,the political response, and the fact his plan is coming together perfectly all at the same time. || Mama Mia - Can’t believe he’s talking as if he’s a medical expert and his smirks laughing at all this. He’s creepy and untrustworthy. We all need to stop looking up to these wealthy people put on a pedestal. Why would this guy be giving all this medical advise and the world following any of his direction? What in the world has happened especially to our country? This video here just makes me and many others, I’m sure, even more uncomfortable with Gates and Fauci. I don’t believe there’s anything Gates can say to make me feel any different. 👎 || D Paul - “955-995k” test a day, I am sure would do American citizens tons of justification (Mr.Gates). || Rodrigo Dutardo - Gill gates said 700,000 injuries from his covid vaccine is acceptable. Remember that when he pushes his medical facism on you: || Andrew Scotton - Total tests mean NOTHING.  Its about every week! || Mark Oppuse - When did Gates become authority on vaccines? Good call CNN bringing on this shyster I guess you're in on the agenda as well.🖕😡 || Kayan Powell - If you plan something you would know that it  is coming Bill Gates || David Mccully - He smiles because humans are the virus he wants to eradicate || Lakha Sankar - He should be the first one to take the vaccine..the next one must be Fauci || Rickey Claiborne - I feel like Bill Gates is the one who planned this pandemic because he’s smiling way too much like he’s enjoying that this is happening. || Gary Miller - Remember the old Frankenstein films....the villagers always burned down his castle with him and his monster in it in the end !!! || Suzanna Marland - Are we still listening to these control freaks... ! ?! 😎🥰🌍 || keith sleeman - Bill Gates helped CREATE this panedemic. Only the elites like him benefit from it. || Michellle Israel Barnes - 🙋‍♀️ I have a serious question. With all of this talk about who is qualified to respond to COVID19 in regards to vaccination & other health related concerns, how come Bill Gates's opinion is given considerable value, since he is not a medical expert?🤔 || Jim Bob - Watch clay Clark call him out as a pedo, what a legend!! || lucifer lavey - oh boy, he wants to implant a micro-chip into our necks!

So anybody that appears to be happy is happy because of something evil they are doing to me. || Medical Speech-language pathologist - He predicted it? Yes because a globalist can see the future rather than plan it and profit from it || Gary Lewis - Gates is correct. Churchill once said ( paraphrase) ""That I lie goes around the world once before the truth has breakfast. || ᴜɴᴇX̶ᴘᴇᴄᴛᴇᴅ Masterpiece - Agendavirus || BLACK ZEALOT - Remember, the earth was handed over to the wicked (aka the "" the low self esteemers, aka the so called elites) who have given their hearts unto the spirit of darkness.

And I believe Cooper is on that list as well. 🙏 Bless the children. Lord save us all || Claudine Schultz - I predicted the pandemic when I had the legionnaires flu yrs ago  & again with the ebola ..  Gates probably knows little more than any healthnut.  This is insane since no one living person can speak with experience. Yet are treated as if they are experts because they are monied or popular, 
We need to wake up to the facts tiihat China wasn't honest about the virus.  The count of patients is  off in nursing homes & hospitals, If an elderly person dies of anything , it will be counted as cv-virus, even if they die of something else, it is not being diagnosed by tests or autopsy.   It's easier & pays better plus fits the dnc agenda More tha few personnel have told reporters & others.   || JJzoomerbear - Hmmm he’s got something special in that shot for you 😈 || John Matthews - Prediction or new my guess its the later look at the friends he keeps and funds so much into these things he  will have half the worlds vaccine surplise 💉💰💰💰💰💰💰💰 very evil man  i think . || DasEichenlaub - Planning and predicting are two different things || randomblackguy95 - ""predicted it""?! is gates nostradamus or a prophet now?

Experts have repeatedly been asking the CDC to do a vaxxed versed the unvaxxed study on children and they say ""they will NEVER do that study"" seriously? If you don't have anything to hide and you're so confident they safe do the flipping study....Africa did the that study....and the results were NOT GOOD....Africa told Bill Gates to take his vaccines in shove them up his ass and get the hell out of the country.

If you want to listen to someone who is 'rich' & who actually is a doctor,
then listen to Michael J. Burry on the Covid-19 lockdowns in the 'Citizen' - well worth reading ! 
I will also certainly listen to Swedish Epidemiologist Professor Johan Giesecke : - ""Why Lockdowns Are The Wrong Policy."" || Daisy Wood - where is the proof your an expert GATES || james morton - software weenies sound smart, what has he done ?  go up against trump ?   no || Erin lee Hendricks - Can you belief that cnn new dr  dr bil  gates not even completing his college what a joke || Jay Motivate - Created & Predicted are two different things || Sebastián Lambert - So, Israel is a legitimate state? || L M - Interesting...he just said ""Deaths are down""...that is good...this is hopeful.

Crimes against humanity || Alpha Ebenezer - He only predicted what he and his associates planned! Prophet Bill freaking Gates! || R Long - I have a couple questions that should be considered very important for all of us to know.
one is Why the media doesn’t ask Bill Gates about the practice drill for Covid19 he ran months prior to the public even knowing ANYTHING about COVID-19?
Two Is how he claims the research and studies prove the vaccines don’t cause autism if they have not done any safety or affective studies on vaccines in over 32 years? is how he claims the research and studies prove the vaccines don’t cause autism if they have not done any safety or affective studies on vaccines in over 32 years?  || muntazir zia - 2:43 Bill completely dodges that question(they wanted him to talk about trump) || CD Perez - Bill's ""depopulate the planet by 10 percent thru Vaccines "" video is a good one as well || Amish Cabins - Bill gates must be a doctor || randy tabron - Did him and China make it what I think now wants people to have his vaccine no way any thing him and China touch I have no need for || Brett Bayford - What I think is, especially considering all the speculation of Bill Gates starting the epidemic is that no one in general population can have the meds or vaccine, too much bin trash needs to be wiped off the earth no left or right about straight up mass culling || Rizzo Cizzo - Say ahhhhhhhhhh !!!!! || william burford sr - Of course he predicted the Virus......He had a major hand in covid-19 combine with the W.H.O.  and Communist China. || Chulo Escobar - He didn't predicted they made it || coa lakmi - this is just sick to play with whole world and lie ... sick ... || Marie Bowser - Bill Gates please take your vaccine || Revolved Silence - Bill Gates.🤔... the guy who's been praying for a pandemic for years... telling us that we need to do more?

I’d like an expert to break down his reaction. He knew too much. || Skeeter Davis - Watergate, Russia gate now Bill gate || Bob Loblaw - # of cases is irrelevant, especially knowing the ""outbreak"" is happening within the younger crowd, which almost NEVER results in hospitalization and/or death-just like the flu. US COVD deaths-per-1 million individuals is the ONLY IMPORTANT STATISTIC. In June, 2020 US number was 327. Belgium was 825, UK-641, Spain-606, Italy-573, Sweden-502, France-442 and so on. We were much better than almost every similar-sized European country and no country has our diversity. It was summer in Southern Hemisphere when virus began, so numbers were low-for now. CDC reported 60,000+ deaths from influenza (which is also referred to as coronavirus) in 2018-19. CDC predicted a record outbreak of influenza in US and worldwide for 2019-20 and announced that over 10 million cases were recorded in Jan., 2020.

Vaccinations probe?
Something doesn't sounds right here from a man who want population control.. || Lydia Ogoti - This is the reason I stopped watching CNN. Allowing liars to continuously fool and blind the public. What business does an I.T. Businessman got to do with discussing subjects that are not his domain apart from having invested heavily in the pharmaceutical companies. Anyways whether I voice my view on this forum or not, he is smiling all the way to the bank as we continue to suffer from the effects of this pandemic. I wish I heard him say I am giving ten percent of my money to people of whom have lost jobs for the next ten years...ha! It'd rain chocolate muffins || GOD'S CHOSEN - Not a prediction...PLAN!!!! PLANDEMIC!!! || Eugene Vaux - The reason?

He wasn't directly answering their questions. || Seamonkies321 - To the anti mask people

HEAR HIS DEMANDS NOW."" || Mike Gall - I'm honestly afraid of him and his wife.  They are something straight out of a Horror movie.  If you notice he never gets mad or argues or raises his voice with ppl, and smiles a lot.  These sound like good traits but he will stay level headed and smile the whole time he wipes out 20% of the population! || mark raven - Larry, Curley and Moe || Avis Tumpkin - We all seen COVID-19 over in China.

But the real story is that while polio has statistically disappeared from India, there has been a huge spike in cases of non-polio acute flaccid paralysis (NPAFP)– the very types of crippling problems it was hoped would disappear with polio but which have instead flourished from a new cause. || Paul Hamill - Community circulation is the big danger.

Bill Gates is already getting back lashes from the world. Gupta should be talking this way, he's the doctor, and he ain't believable either. He couldn't get a word in. Gates is really involved in this whole covid-19,  prediction scam and the people are waking up and  recognizing it. CNN, I don't know what the hell y'all doing, going along for the ride, I'm a big fan of CNN too, for a short period of time . || David Jones - Dr. Gates is speaking....

Event201. Id2020. Agenda21. Agenda30. || Udo C.-M. - My opinion he is a very dangerous man this Gates || JA Douglas - Imagine being Bill Gates right now.
You spend 30 years of your life and $50 billion of your own dollars supporting humanitarian causes. You directly save hundreds of thousands of lives in South East Asia by providing anti malaria netting to half of a continent, you drop infant mortality rates throughout the entire developing world by funding vaccine programs including vaccinating 40,000,000 children for polio, and, amongst a plethora of philanthropic endeavors, you fund free educational platforms like Khan Academy so people can have free access to high quality education. || Diane Young - The Federal government needs to provide supplies to states in order to test all these cases and also order manufacturers to make  PPE for healthcare workers who desperately need them in this crisis. || BTsMusicChannel - Exactly who we need to hear from right now, the neo-feudal overlord, a de facto government in himself who should have redistributed his resources to prepare for the problem identified, Bill Gates.

I cant believe CNN is still on.. they should all wear masks... I mean muzzles!!! || Toni L. - He sounds like he’s mincing his words. Tippy Toeing around criticizing this administration. What is his connection with Individual 1 again? || umakanth balachandran - If u do more testing u find more cases that's normal. Camper to other countries u.s. death rate very Low. Under the president Trump leadership he save many Americans 
BUT media don't like truths that's very sad. || Shawn Fellows - @Anderson Cooper @Bill Gates have either of you purchased from Jeffrey Epstein? I have seen physical presence of Bill Gates with Jeffrey Epstein, so that is very suspect. I haven't seen that with Anderson Cooper, but why does he ignore Bill's connection with Jeffrey Epstein? He obviously knows Bill Gates interacted with Jeffrey Epstein after he was convicted of trafficking children. Why is Cooper treating Bill Gates as an expert on COVID-19? Bill has also said that we can reduce the population if we do a really great job with vaccines, healthcare and reproductive health services. || Mike Stokes - Aaaaaahhhhhhhhhh, how can the guys aaaaahhhhh on the outside  aaaahhhh  keep a straight face.  How can anybody believe these lies. || ange daniel zue - Hey gates, when are going to invest your billions in order to eradicate homelessness in america ?

Since it only really affects the old and those with underlying issues. Saying zmerica done the worst??? They have the most ventilators, most testing in the planet.....this video just proves its the democrats playing this game.

while wearing a mask is political corrects in China as well, so people wear it. || Cristina D - He didn't predict...he create the virus.....and CNN and mass media must be closed forever. || C J - America (USA): the most conspiratorial country in the world,.. 
(comments in here) || Noriel de Leon - I don't know about you people who believe this guy...common sense dictates that the reason he was able to predict the pandemic is because him, Dr. Fauci and the other people of their kind  are the ones behind this C19... || Satyanarayana Guda - Economics is behaviour, intent and quality of ruling ministers. I will take a small example of AP/TELANGANA STATES WHICH I BELONG TO. THESE STATES SPEND MONEY ON SEVERAL SOCIAL WELFARE SCHEMES. THESE ARE THE DAYS OF DEADLY CORONA WHICH ACTUALLY CALLS FOR HEALTH AND ECONOMIC EMERGENCY. THERE FREE MONEY SCHEMES LIKE RYTHI BHAROSA/RYTHU BANDHU, AMMAVODI SO ON AND SO FORTH. THESE ARE GO9D SCHEMES OR NOT IS IS MY DEBATE OR QUESTION. THE AMOUNT SPENT ON THESE SCHEMES (FREE CASH TRANSFERS/DBT) IS ABOUT 15000 CRORE RUPEES PER STATE PER YEAR. A WISE AND RESPONSIBLE GOVT/POLITICAL PARTY (RULING) WOULD HAVE SUSPENDED THESE FOR ONE YEAR AND ESTABLISHED CORONA ERADICATION MISSION. THIS WOULD HAVE SERVED TO ERADICATE CORONA IN AP/TS STATE/S BY NOW AND IN THE PROCESS SAVED EC9NOMY WORTH AT LEAST 60 THOUSAND CRORES. BUT DO YOU THINK THERE IS ANY MINISTER WORTH HIS/HER SALT AND HAS BARE MINIMUM KNOWLEDGE TO APPLY MIND ON THESE LINES AND ERADICATE CORONA? JUST IMAGINE WITH 12000 CRORE RUPEES WHAT COULD HAVE BEEN THE HUMAN RESOURCES THAT COUPD HAVE BEEN RECRUITED AND TRAINED AND PUT ON JOB ON THE CEM? WHAT K8ND OF CORONA ISO LATION AND QUARANTINE LEVEL 1 AND 2 INSTITUTIONAL CENTERS WOULD HAVE BEEN ORGANISED AND HOW MUCH IF CRITICAL CARE PRESSURE WOULD HAVE BEEN REDUCED AND HIW MANY PAID PRIVATE CORONA CENTERS WIULD HAVE BEEN FACILITATED? SO ECONOMIC WUSDOM IS ZERO AMONG POLITICIANS AND ANOTHER TRUTH IS THAT MANY MINISTERS DO NOT KNOW FIRST ALPHABET KNOWLEDGE FOR GET KNOWING ANY THING. || Madam Butterfly - He saw it coming because he had a hand in creating it...when did this man study science and become a Doctor... were supposed to listen to a man who wants to depopulate the world.. sounds like a nazi Doctor in my opinion... this man is a Sociopath... the world has woke up to these people only problem we have is the GATES OF HELL DOESNT REALISE IT YET... can't wait to see these people in a court of law for crimes against humanity....wasnt Bill Gates on Epsteins flight log after he was charged with Child Sex Abuse...ye save the world my arse.. abuse it more like in the name of a humanitarian.. || underyourskin - This is the result you get when you make wealthy people feel like gods...

There seems to be a huge issue surrounding him and ""safe and secure vaccines"". || Avis Tumpkin - Our president stayed in other countries and bringing the pandemic from India and others that was dealing with pandemic. Maybe he didn't get sick but other did. || Twilitblack - Bill Gates is one of the biggest funder of the WHO now that the US bowed out. That alone makes me not want to trust him. || Yassir Ali - More like plannedemic! || Gordon Smith-Durán - Come on. Let's think about this, everyone. Your neighbour says that in two months your car is going to burn. In two months, sure enough it burns.  You think one of two things: either the neighbour is psychic or he had something to do with the burning. So.sure he was that he organised event 201 as a.dummy run in November of 2019.

I read y'all are on track for globalism January 2021 || John connor - The coronovirus is a Hoax plandemic || Pep Lar - They've twisted people's words about the testing, they're saying that the more tests you take, the more the numbers are going to go up. Doesn't necessarily mean that area has more cases, just that they're testing more than other areas. This is ignoring all those false positives and 'accidentally' doubled figures of course. || Steven Conrady - Bill Gates didn’t just PREDICT the virus he CREATED and RELEASED it onto the world to destroy humanity. Thus, creating the NEW WORLD ORDER!! WAKE UP, PEOPLE!!! || Carlos Sam - The bible have to fullfull no per son will stop that. || Master Of None - So how are our nuclear/emp/cyber/hypersonic/etc etc preparations doing...

I am challenging you to prove me that I am crazy but if you don't, meaning you are just afraid that I am going to be famous or I become rich. The medicine would only cost anyone about 15 US dollars.

Should Humanity take the path of evolving into an extremely complex society (human super-organism) it must be well prepared to bear the burden imposed on its components; millions of cells die daily in the human body, yet we hardly empathize or even feel their plight while we enjoy their services. So Humanity, better prepare for millions of casualties as collateral damage in the service of this future human super-organism. || Jenova - China +80k = Total Lockdown

Oh what a surprise.
He must be a prophet
With far seeing eyes. || Teguh Duduk - He is killer || Deborra Strom - Hummm. Are you a physician Mr. GATES?

9:17 - In the Area of TESTING... || mad max - Of Course he knew it, he is the man who has vaccine prepared 20 years ago. It is a planned event and his vaccine is deadly. Just see the truth that is in your face, and do some research on Google 🙏 He is a sick psychopath. || Tatiane Silva - Gente coloquem a legenda em Português por favorrr, I LOVE Bill Gates ❤️ || The7287678 - All vaccines include toxic mercury, aluminum, formaldehyde, phenoxyethanol (antifreeze), and squalene adjuvants that weaken and can destroy the human immune system, making it vulnerable to many annoying to life-threatening illnesses.
Among other dangers, inoculated individuals will risk becoming ill from the coronavirus instead of being protected from infection by being vaxxed. || borderguyeh87 - Playstation is I better Billy lmao || xzero89 - it's easy to control the populus if the enemy is invisible. || E3 - Certificate Of Vaccine I D 19 = Chip in wrist = Patent Microsoft has for chip in wrist with Microsoft crypto currency = This is how governments are planning on fighting back against bitcoin and monero.

Maybe we could stop supporting Microsoft globally and feeding money to this supposed benefactor of mankind? || Brett Sloma - The exact words were ""digital immunity proof"".

You are really incompetent. || Taran Singh The Parolier - When bill gate came on screen , for a while I thought it's steven Hawkins.😱 but then I realized it's bill gates the man who predicted a pandemic. || SaRa 4Rheal - He's creepy.  Personally.... I have absolutely no trust in this man. and his intentions || Paulo Cortez - Hearing this feels like we're being played in ac0mputer game. || ramban321 - Why is he interested in Viruses and vaccines?  Who appointed him ? Why? What's in it for him? His DNA vaccine is a crime against Humanity. He belongs in jail. Now, before he wipes 1/2 of world population. || Juan Caceres Guerrero - 3:36 why did you edited it off? || Aparna Shakti - Corona virus has engulfed so many lives and is still   a deadly disease . What is your opinion || lisa K - He said most people survive this
Then he said we need vaccines to keep high fatalities down. || halley oey - need to know their internet provider for this smooth interview || B1G_BAZ - So when is Bill gates being arrested for crimes against humanity?? || Anna Firth - This is so over edited... Let him speak freely would you. || Hillel Flesch - Bill you are so, so happy ""humanitarian"". Your face is shining,  your smile goes around your head. Talking about the deaths of real people like they are characters in some video games. I've been here from the time before the Earth was made and witnessed all human deeds. I can tell you Billy, no matter how much you try YOU will finish your life like all people during history. There is no escape from the death no matter how much someone tries. No genetic research can save you. I follow you from the moment you were born. I know your secrets, your feelings, your deeds. I know when you lie,  when you are afraid (mostly all the time). Basically, no one loves you including your wife and kids. Your associates pretend that they appreciate you. Without money, you know deep down that you are nobody. Every time I see you I feel in my heart sad and sorry for you. I know all about you. I feel your unhappiness. Sometimes I even cry when I see how unhappy you are.  Do not try to ""help"" humanity because this is not your job. You do not own them. They can do better off without you. So be calm and wait your time to join the rest who had lived on this planet. I was told to say this like Moses was told to write his book. || jon webster - it had never occured to me that vaccines / antibodies are grown on various animal tissues and then injected into adults and in usa; babies. fcol. watch a real scientist talk like Mikovits or a real doctor like Buttar. || MonkeyspankO - Whats most shocking about all this is how few people appear to understand this sort of situation. Or to rephrase more appropriately, how MANY clearly don't understand || Fault Finder - TRIVIA: Is the Virus a ""MAN MADE"" by the result of the new elevated technology that's going on in the air that we cannot see in our own ""Naked Eye"" only a few who sees it and responsible for all of this...SPECULATING ONLY! It's all up to you to analyze and decide what it means.Thanks..! || gohn k - The elite are always trying to save the world. I thank you the elite for fixing world hunger and saving the children who are getting raped and trafficked almost everyday. Hopefully you succeed in your vaccinations and the microchip so you know we are vaccinated. And thank you for the 5g. I put my trust in you.

There is nothing funny about the thousands of people loosing their lives because of a virus he and other evil scientist have created! || brucolerba - Why am i listening health advices from a billionaire without any health qualification and who btw has created the most virus infected operative system ever?! And why are you too ??? || Woken One - 34:14 Can't wait to get my Vacine Certificate ID yesss! Thank you daddy gates <3 || Paul Kossey - Bill Gates Talks About Injections WILL Lead to At Least Some BIG MISTAKES 1) There are 290 (!) BIG AND small countries and NOONE WANTS CORONAVIRUS INJECTIONS FOR CHILDREN 2) as You get older and smarter ITS UNPLEASANT to see An Coding Empire that an Always Modern OS it could be in different times BECOME A REALLY TINY PERCENTGE || Carl Kuss - What he says here makes a lot of sense. He should be given much credit as a humanitarian. I would still argue with him about eugenics, but I don´t see him as the Incarnation of Evil.  We don´t need scapegoats.  We don´t need nutty conspiracy theories. We have our hands full with reality at the moment. || Chris Pecherzewski - sounds so good huh?? it's all about CONTROL! Government  takeover for  depopulation.   I have a Constitutional Right not to be vaccinated   'it's my body it's my choice' stop the BS... learn from Korea?? I don't think so. Who is Bill Gates, now  an expert on a weak virus? This is all FEAR based. || gabrielle upton - Can someone PLEASE tell me how a college dropout has become the worlds leading health expert?? And How is it that without a medical license, Mr. Gates has been filmed administering immunizations without said license? I am certain that in order to act as a medically trained professional, one MUST be in possession of that REQUIRED MEDICAL LICENSE! || Yul Hubbart - BILL GATES IS KERMIT THE FRAUD. || Mrdruggedalien - Why is Bill laughing so much? does he see some money for the future in his labs,s? easy prediction in 2015 to set it up in the future? || komsya - what, if we create machines able to predict?



real-time event response technology

based on fog computations || terry walker - Bill Gates is a nutcase! || Paula Harris Baca - If Bill Gates thinks that the earth has too many people, which he apparently believes because he doesn't look at the empty regions of the world, why wouldn't he want to have a massive 1918 Spanish Flu epidemic (which I personally am glad about, or I wouldn't personally be here. My grandma's first husband and she both caught the Spanish Flu and he died, so she remarried my grandpa, who had my mom, and then I came along to consume Microsoft products) which would hopefully wipe out millions and millions of people. And each war we have kills off even more people. And of course, when you start packing Europe with huge quantities of people who aren't physically adapted to the climate and have completely different belief systems and cultures, you are causing huge masses additional consumption of goods in those countries who were at a nice, stable population level.   || Dr.Tanveer Ahmed, Ph.D - It is too astonishing and so undeniably amazing that such guys totally non-reliant, accompanied collectorate partner of Dijjali System, his team agenda depopulation is the invisible enemy to the rest of humanity's collapsing economies, boosting poverty enriched suicidal approaches and huge massive criminality causing huge flooded litigation further HBO disclosing inside total different story about Hybrid Seeds, GM Seeds, BT Seeds, and Super GM Seeds eliminated from this world pretty possessed patent from FDA/NHS co-ordinator, funder and the mastermind of such corona-virus, damn.devil1 {([you can save yourself and protect by spiritual meditation nourish your heart and soul via tranquility likewise])} this link is appropriate for your better consequences || Lando Polo - This is like a sequel for us who saw bill's 2015 talks due to the Youtube algorithm recommending it couple weeks ago. || Sounak Roy - Once again why would we listen to Bill Gates for a pandemic study/virology? What is his credentials?  Excuse my ignorance. || Soros Promnok - Very spotted on predictions back then and well informed of  a “how to”  now and it makes me just WOWwww, sire Bill..... || Plain - kinda Gates and Musk turned their outsider status in childhood into an evil allmighty powerful opposite. you are both loved, but please, go to Mars, and leave us alone. || Иван Елизаров - At first: take your part in creating the pandemy and making people fear.
At second: just suggest a digital vaccine.
Um, thank you, mr. Gates! || HiP CoLouR - 16:32 Bills face. You won't regret it || Olga Ismag - Why Ted talks interviews Bill Gates about VIRUSES? DO WE HAVE MEDICAL TRAINED DISEASE SPECIALIST IN US? it would be good when  ""shoemaker making shoes and the baker bake the bread"" 
Invite epidemiologist for those questions! || Nothing Less Than Epic - They create the problems then sell the solutions. || Remember to Love - Zika, Ebola, Sars and Mers (and COVID-19 as of 16.April 2020) are all PATENTED disease, that means they are MANMADE!!!!
Start thinking, they create the problem and now they are trying to force us to take their poison! || Bryan Ding - I definitely agree with Bill gates about being prepared for another virus but I disagree with him saying that nothing was done. First of all do you think that all of America or even the whole world watched the ted talk 5 years ago. I mean of course not. || bardownaint - Bills house looks like an airport. || WEAPONS_OFMASS DISTRACTION_71 - Do not rich men opress you, and draw you before the judgement seats? || Tim Kerstetter - He's so excited and loving it. I'll get him. 50 cal thermal sight. Second he farts above the temperature the pandemic is over. || Iwan Malinin - Thanks 😊 || Alejandro - 4:10

I TRUST billionaire Bill! || tarre tan - Wow Microsoft Teams™ seems like a great product for online conference and business communications || 7ruach9 - Does anyone notice he ahs as much as Trudeau does when he talks? Not good at all || Alexandro Betancourt - Bill Gates good luck chuck a huge finger will drop on your head .       Jesus still Loves you AMEN AMEN || Jester Infester - Fascinating! TED usually brings notable experts in a field to introduce new ideas. How does Bill Gates earn time for an advertisement on TED for the Coronavirus  when he developed one of the worst computer operating systems in history. I suppose he has a few extra $billion to share to use TED to lend an air of credibility or reliability to his opinions, banal as they are, to be heard more effectively. Isn’t that why no one listened to him the first time? I mean it must be great to be a multibillionaire and also have a foundation in which to hide $billions more. Still it doesn’t make him a virologist or Epidemiologist or even make him more convincing. Wasn’t the state he lives in one of the hardest hit on the west coast? Me thinks he has ulterior motives and this talk is more infomercial for his home test kit. Let’s see, scare the crap out of everyone around the globe with computer models that we now know were garbage, then run to the rescue and save the whole world with a home test for just $19.95. 🤑😷🙄 || Cecile Goforit - Why did he say in 2010 then we could reduce population number thanks to vaccines, Health Care and Reproductive Health Services? 
Isn't it contradictory to want to ""save lives"" today when 10 years before he litterally said we could lower population by 10/15%? || Armando Ideas - One thing he didn't took, is: we have to pick better leaders, not just clowns that make us laugh. || guloguloguy - IMHO: This ""deadly, MAN-MADE, ""BIO-WEAPON"" (COVIDvirus), looks like it has been designed to kill older, weaker people, essentially culling those ""useless eaters"" that NAZIs sought to eliminate.... || Jean Dziadosz - I just remembered, my doctor Ive had for 10 years suddenly started doing ""drug screening"" with a swab kit. Why are they wanted everyone's DNA on file?🤔 || pathfinderdaddy - Shame on TED
Totally discredited || Silverback OR - what about the virus you tried to sell to the US government?  how did that go.  seems very similar to the parameters that were set out in your BUG. HOW MUCH MONEY DO YOU make on this current ""issue""? || A punk Daydream - Lamunan Oi! - 25:03 Correcting Bill Gates on a number, how must that feel... || natija08 - The Spanish flu was so deadly because there was a war in Europe (1914-18), many poeple didn't have enough and very little healthy things to eat because they were poor or the economy was so down. I read that many US-soldiers got the Spanish flu, BECAUSE they were vaccined. Our immune system is made to fight any virus. It only needs Vit. C, Vit. D and zinc. The Corona-virus is not as dangerous as Bill Gates wants to tell us. He only wants to earn a lot of money from all of his investments in pharmaceutical companies. Therefore his plan is to vaccine the whole mankind - and - because the corona-virus as an RNA-virus mutates so quick - he will earn a lot of money every year. Sweden is an example that a shutdown isn't necessary. China isn't a democracy. || Dcode Moon - I think these chips are about to watch people who are seeking about Quantum computers because they are the most scary thing and Bill Gates is already into computers we all know that..... || JackieChan 4525 - I’m not gonna trust someone who wants to vaccinate every one with no choice. He also supports the World Healy organization, who is a communist. || citizenY - Do not trust this man. || Awwab Abdelrazig - What we have all been waiting for . . . || Leonard Patty - Lot of stupid people here, i can see tht || Camp Literature_ ជំរំបណ្ណាល័យសាស្ត្រ - Stay safe!! || Christopher George - Interestingly, Gates is related to the Rockefeller's on his mothers side. His father worked for Planned Parenthood. He was raised to fulfill this role. || cynthia g - Bill is smiling about people concerned about not being able to work and crashing the economy!!!  Smiling........yep, Bill, we know you don't worry about that. || Michael JW - 34:35 When Bill was asked whether or not his foundations are involved in manufacturing the test kits, the answer gets cut out || Manuel Blanquel - So through this ""digital immunity proof"" Goverment is going to determine if im healthy or not ? If i can go anywhere or do anything?                                               So im guessing that immune systems and freedom are out of the table.                 I cant understand why Bill became “the expert” on public health policy and they keep asking for his opinion. Very very suspicious || Ivan Juarez - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_NLAnm7bCY

CV is NOT scary for me at all. || Lin White - you are not a doctor, Bill, nor an expert || K C - Mr. Gates, a few weeks before my dad passed away he had visions and went back-n-forth from this reality to the other side and brought back some interesting information.  One thing was that he unwittingly predicted an event that would happen to me.  The thing was, he thought that it had already happened and was asking me about it.  I didn't know what to think and told him no that hasn't happened to me, but I wrote it down how he described it.  And lo and behold, it came true about 10 months later!  Just the way he saw it!  In one of his other visions, he saw you, Mr. Gates.  Yep he saw you.  He first said that you were Lucifer, then he corrected himself and said ""no no Bill Gates isn't Lucifer but he's a lot like him, evil like Lucifer"" - Mr. Gates its coming out.

So thank you covid for opening my eyes more, namaste 🙏 || B F - Of course his predictions came true, it's not intelligence or amazing hindsight, as his worshippers may believe. It's because he planned this. Gates helped create this pandemic. Gates funded the Wuhan lab where the virus was released and then spread around the globe. 63,000 Americans died of the flu in 2019. No shut downs, nothing. Now all of a sudden, the government is so concerned about the lives of the older population they're going to tank the economy? Wake up. This is about power. This about control. || Rohit Pai - Wow, basically an online ted talk! || dekdek nav - Bill Gates should enjoy the remaining few years of his life.

Bill Gates took control of India’s National Technical Advisory Group on Immunization (NTAGI) which mandated up to 50 doses (Table 1) of polio vaccines through overlapping immunization programs to children before the age of five. Indian doctors blame the Gates campaign for a devastating non-polio acute flaccid paralysis (NPAFP) epidemic that paralyzed 490,000 children beyond expected rates between 2000 and 2017. In 2017, the Indian government dialed back Gates’ vaccine regimen and asked Gates and his vaccine policies to leave India. NPAFP rates dropped precipitously. || Patachon Patachon - Check out what he did in India. || Elizabeth V - Bill gates is evil. He likely helped fund the creation of this virus.

Some researchers says -virus was created in the lab. 
is he behind this pandemic? || Michał Cyran - There is no SARS-CoV-2 virus. There is no pandemic. There is no need to respond. In fact, trying to think about how to respond is dangerous because then you are starting to believe in a lie and are part of it. Think about God. Think about him first. || Alejandra Cadiz - I would like to know when testing will be widely available for the people and not just for politicians, actors and the wealthy... || Elisa Dach - Ask India how damaging Bill's polio venture has been. || Frani Dance - Don't be fooled by this guy.

Many are seeing it as a seizable opportunity to have greater control over the public.

Is Hillary the great great great grand daughter of Lolith? Not just because she eats babys or has people killed! || peter dochev - As soon as it is possible for the authorities to declare any contagious virus a deadly epidemic and a mandatory quarantine for the whole society, it will be possible to introduce a mandatory immunization and an immunization passport. It must be said that this is fascism, aggression against human nature and existence. There are no such epidemics in nature, they are the fruit of sick brains with sick fantasies or big fraudulent intentions. || Donald Quirk - Hey Bill Gates here is your digital certificate 🖕 || Sound of Gugu - As an after thought.. Gates is Dr Evil? (Austin Powers) “1 Trillion Dollars!” || Robbie Craughwell - They say psychopaths hide in open site! || Mark Arnold - The overwhelming majority of farmed animals are kept in dark, unsanitary, overcrowded factory farms, which stresses their immune systems. Worse, they’re bred primarily for rapid growth and maximum output, not robustness, and their genetic similarity makes them especially likely to transmit disease to one another. || AsA INNOVARE - COVID-19 is actually are EXOSOMES not a Virus that invades your body but it is the reaction of real cause of illness generated inside our Respiratory illness caused production of exosomes which induces Poison, electromagnetic radiation (5G), stress (fear), Toxic substances, Ionizing radiation, Infection, Injury, Immune response, Asthma, Diseases.  || P A - Liar liar || Victoria Love - Why is Bill Gates such a pharmaceutical pusher?

Gates other vaccines for 3rd world countries have killed, sterilized, and paralyzed Babis, children, women & men. He has gotten off for these crimes because e of loophole laws for pharmaceutical companies not being held responsible for. He is for world depopulation! His wife wears an upside down cross.

Same is the case this being used by Migraine patients. This has been tried by many patients with excellent results. Why not do research on this Mudra Yoga. Similarly practicing Pran Mudra and Varun Mudra. || honey dew - love this, it's so interesting listening to Bill Gates talk about this || My Will - Greatest darkest mind || Enver Gökce - Der Billi Boy gehört hinter Schloss und Riegel. || Android Gamer - He appears quite friendly, benign and harmless, doesn't he?

Shut down so you can take over the world... one world order, one world currency, a chip to track everyone.. Mark of the Beast! || Gordon Law - Your vacation will not be taken!! || Linda J. S. Anderson - The bible says keep your enemies close. He is smart and rich so everybody would rather knock him down. That's the a American way.  When in fact we need to know he is putting word out and possibly because we are suppose to be told or fore warned. Which we Americans have to much to do instead of paying attention. It's our fault we ignored the signs because we were weak. We were to busy being on top to worry about what's going on below. Which brings to mind our military. Do we really live so high above that we in the eye's of other countries are just letting military handle it handle it. We were made from God and Earth. Which makes Earth Mother Earth.  We should be down to Earth not trying to be better than our Father (GOD). || Weird Cell - Did he say ""I told you so""? || Ken Side - I really liked the questions the interviewer covered:
- even tho China is starting to operate as normal again, is it really believable that the virus is not still circulating around? 
- why did governments fail to act faster? || Samuel Ma - Thank you. Mr. Gates. || Tiago Ribeiro - Don't ever take a vaccine created or finnanced from this guy. || I agree too. - The amount of Karens here in this comment section is so sad.. || hamish r - The Chinese are not a credible source of information. .they do not care about the billions of disposable citizens...they are already blaming this outbreak on foreigners...and of course you will never be aware of the real stats || joe moonblue - this is a live exercise to stress test systems , in preparation for the next virus || We Love Hugs - A better title of this video would be:  how can Bill Gates control all the people who are being misled about a virus that has one goal: to cause a TOTAL CONTROL WORLD SYSTEM ! || Scott Auctions - Ask Gates if he and his family will be ""VACCINATED"" || Ejay Emm - Bill Gates is a ""health expert"" yall 🙄 I didn't know drop outs were qualified to force vaccinations on people || Vincent Blake - Devil || Scott Campbell - It’s not just the ventilators you need the personnel to go along with them || Perseverance - Its Dr Death!

More billions from selling vaccines for Bill. || humphrey javu - Event 201 || Alan Wilson - there is a very obvious ""tell tale"" sign that bill is lying....... his lips move || kmp1066 - He warned about a pandemic because he helped to create it!!! He's a weird evil man. || Altair Anjilo N de Almeida - In all this talk of 'helping people', nowhere did he say or suggest the very simple, very cheap ways to boost the immune system to reduce risks of getting the infection. So when people say this man has Humanity improvement as his goal, I am very suspicious. There's Vit D, Sunlight (FREE!), Vit C, eating well (NOT EATING JUNK FOOD AND SUGAR). That's simple info. NO TRACE! Only his mission to create vaccines, and to force everyone to have them. This is already law in Germany for future workers to have a certificate of vaccination or no job! He stands to make $45 Billion if everyone is vaccinated. Not bad for his $1Billion investment in 7 Vaccine drug creators. No, sorry I don't buy it. Too many questions and very dubious answers. || Musiclover - Gates is evil. We thought he was just a nerdy guy who wants to help the world.   Now will you look at him again?  He must be stopped, with his friend's of course || Black Gold - Notice that the media isnt mentioning 'chinas draconian measures' anymore because they will soon emforce it globally. || Lars D - ""We are trying..."".

Wonder what that was about || adriano 1488 - kill bill 3 uma turman chopped his head off , || SLIDINGINTOIT - THEY HAVE NOT isolated a virus, they are NOT testing for a virus, and they are NOT concocting ""vaccines"".....WAKE UP. || Gabriela D. - This is the ""I told you so"" video? || lovepeacebliss - gates has financial ties to john hopkins, who ""tracks"" global data. Hes creating the fear and offering the solution. || Jake Williams - 34:39 Why did you cut out the part where Gates says, ""So eventually there will be this digital immunity proof that will help facilitate the global reopening up.""
?????????????????????????????????????????????
That's a pretty monumental statement by Gates. What are you hiding, TED? || Jack Zhang - Reading all the comments, it amazed me how many anti-intellectual people the US has.

It's also time... || terryberry28 - BILL... YOU ARE NOT A DOCTOR or a scientist at all... || Профессор Преображенский - A vaccinated dog with a chip is an animal of a person, a vaccinated person with a chip is an animal of Bill Gates, Bill Gates is an animal of the devil. the beast of gates brings the prophecy from Revelation John 13:15, including for atheists. If they come true, then the prophecies in chapter 14: 9 will come true. For those who apply his vaccine with a digital certificate to their bodies, they will go to eternal torment. || Marcos Mimenza - Money, philanthropy, modeling a threat simulation, spreading it among politicians, that's how the present was inspired. || solarmanhawaii - Loves how he speaks of ""Testing"" ... There Still is NOT a Fool Proof test for COVID-19 to this Day ! || Anis Ali - Why is he laughing, whats so funny about the pandemic and people dying, psychologically Bill gates is giving a-lot away about something they know that we don’t || Kristy Classie - Bill gates is not a dr and does have any medical training whatsoever || Oscar Benitez - Yeah he needs to be interviewed by London real first ? why you came out with the plandemic || cozzastewy - No political system listens to science nowadays. It will literally be an extinction event that we change. I’m an Aussie and our politics is a shamble, funding all the wrong things. Beginning to be less proud day by day || CamShaft - كام شافت - This dude wants everything || rabbit uchiha - Jones was right. His “nelly” image is a facade. Just like most psychopath  murderers who go undetected for a long time, he purposely creates an image of himself to be philanthropic, helpful, endearing with his nerd-like charm, while in reality inside he’s sinister and sadistic. What a truly evil man. || Gemini Flower - Wait, he believes China’s numbers? He is the only person who is praising them because they arrested the doctor who tried to warn everyone. Also China let their citizens fly around the world spreading it everywhere. Why is he smiling so much, this is affecting everyone badly and so he shouldn’t be so happy. || paul horvath - why is  he always laughing when talking about death || T C - Pretty clear to say he's a part of the big boys club now. || Amanda Owens - it's highly fatal/dangerous to baby boomers.... let's be honest, that's why the US is shutting down. || Dora Tsolakis - Isn't this guy a computer geek??? When did this guy become a doctor to advise people on viruses.... seriously !!! || NIAMKE Venance - Ok, Doctor Bill. I see. The Testing for rich countries and the vaccine for impoverished countries. Africa Shall Rise, Yes We Shall || Jason Firewalker - The ""detoxifying"" foot bath advertisement preceding this does nothing to lend credibility to the vital content. || Odnaleziona w czasie - 32:05 In Great Poland they collects the blood plasma of people who have recovered from COVID-19 and gives it to the sick. People who have recovered eagerly donate their plasma three times at intervals. || Dirk de Graaf - 51:49 /51: 51 What happens? || David Paul - That's a beautiful Vista you've got there Bill. || ishmam rahman - If he makes a medicine or a vaccine he is going make a monopoly business and make huge money... thats why he is so happy || Chuck P [again and again] - Why did TED edit out some of what this bozo said?

End game clearly being mandatory global vaccination complete with a complimentary tracking device. The vaccine, remember, being given the green light sans regulatory oversight. The world at large is essentially being held hostage by the pharmaceutical and “health care” industry and the ransom is your compliance with a vaccine that has nothing to do with helping people but everything to do with controlling people. The fact that Fauci is on the board of directors for the Gates foundation who’s stated mission is mandatory global vaccination and at the same time the media has crowned him “America’s doctor” is the very definition of CONFLICT OF INTEREST.

Start here: Circumstantial Evidence in the Law is defined with an image that best suites our purpose here. When you go to bed and the ground is dry and green, but when you wake up there is snow on the ground, it is circumstantially assumed that it snowed, right? Well, when a person talks about a Global pandemic and coronavirus three months, ten months, and even five and ten years earlier, then funds both the company that patented it, becomes an honorary  member of the country it started in, and then creates three different companies to ""combat"" it, all while claiming to put a tracking chip in your hand to show that you were vaccinated from the thought of it being a mere coincidence, or ""on the front lines of it,"" is really a Criminal Court's definition of Circumstantial Evidence of a Criminal Act.

Gates wants protection from injury from the very vaccines he promotes!   Since the 80s no one has the right to sue for injury from vaccines.    What does this tell you America???!!! || Small_EGG Cox - How about lower the salaries of government officials and focus it on the epidemic || Kevin M - Fauci and Gates in bed on this. || ground752 - evil bill gates || Peter Panino - They will give us small almost invisible CHIPS to put under our skin telling machines whether we are vaccinated or not.

Not this time || childof thesun - Bill Gates is an optimist, and he is right, it's great how fast the research is progressing currently and that we can somehow be glad that we don't have a worst-case virus. We will be better prepared when it happens. 
If this doesn't make him look depressed when he talkes about it, so what
The economy will certainly suffer for years to come, but we are not going to see the whole world collapse.  || Coleen S. - I just loved how Bill kept saying ""we"" as in he is one of us.

Look at his demeanor.  If you turn off the sound and watch his body language, you'd swear he was talking about a joyful Event. || YoshiPeach Mario - all the naysayers laughed at the $3 trillion amount years ago... now we're going to suffer exactly that loss.


Tens of billions is nothing in comparison || Browar - <3 <3 <3 || raybeeism - How we shuold resppnd to Bill Gates should be the title. I ain't taking his vaccine. Neither should any of you!!

Truth. || Jonathan Mafi - the classic eye movement of lying XD he shouldve done a bit more with his acting skills. || #BobbleHead - #HopeFromHome || Kasandra Taylor - Herd immunity doesn’t take several years.  He wants the economy to go down. Then the New World Order can begin.  Cripple a nations economy cripple every single man woman and child under their will. World domination through an infectious microbe.  He is evil to the core.He is smiling and acting gleeful about the US shutting down.

Now that video also seems to be gone.  Did he say that or not, because a reporter got it saved before it disappeared.   Why not have Bill and family take the vaccine first in a public video presentation making sure it was actually the 'mass vaccine' first.  BTW, vaccines are made with stem cell lines from aborted fetuses.  Bill's dad was on the board of Planned Parenthood. || Edna Leal - Jesus! Não entendi nada.

Let me start with Basics, as we all know the ground truth that this COVID pandemic is only a risk to these set of people (aged, smokers or any respiratory or pre-existing illness or with less immune system) and also 10 to 20% don’t even have any symptons and 70 to 80% positive cases only have minor issues and they recover, but this video for some reason promotes non vulnerable people also to sit at home??????, if we follow this and the eco-system will create bigger issues to mankind and only online business and few business will grow exponentially…. Where as the young and non vulnerable people, can still go out in streets and do their normal activities so that impacts of eco-system crash to bigger population can be mitigated.  || Kai Bishop - Don't take the test !
Don't take the vaccine !
If you think I'm uneducated and irresponsible for saying this take a GENUINE look at the >> ITNJ << || Krystal Di Marca - I'm sorry but if the FCC makes Stacey disclose that the photo of her drinking #tummytea is a #ad, it would be nice if the FCC could also make those who have heavily invested in big pharma disclose that at the top of interviews about Public Health and Safety. || ndlk dan - we all know how long it will last until you guys decide to stop it || Kasia Kasia - Mam prośbę

A real PUPPET for the world globalist. Wow! || haychex - Pay close attention here people. Here is a perfect example of problem reaction solution. Bill Gates creates the problem by working with others to make the virus, then he gives this reaction to the problem and offers the solution of vaccinating everyone for it.

He should go to GITMO! || viksra - I think what people are overlooking is that the ""stay at home for 14 days"" ""clock"", if you will, gets reset each time someone goes out and meets other people, because they won't know if they have it for up to 14 days later. So if you stay at home for 14 days, but someone outside of your household hasn't stayed at home for the same 14 days as you (as was forced in Wuhan), then everybody's ""staying at home for 14 days"" has effectively gone to waste.

He's talking to a general audience, not TED audiences or professionals. || Teddy Picker - ""Bringing the economy back and doing money, that's more of a reversible thing than bringing people back to life.

A globalist control freak selling fear fear fear for control control control || Adrian - Medical tyranny is here.  Banned.Video || Heavenly Treasures - Event 201 was a rehearsal of Covid19 and yet this country wasn't ready for this pandemic? Something is fishy behind all this. In order for a new world order to happen they must collapse the economy and have people vulnerable. This is going according to their plan. Next will be mandatory vaccines and then a cashless society...and all this was predicted in the Bible, yet people refuse to believe in God. || Marney Cohen - 1885 Smallpox outbreak in Montreal Canada, Edward Jenner took credit for the eradication of it, people caused riots against vaccines back then, instead of fresh water, sanitation, and good food for the decline…and why on earth are these viruses being kept in military labs same as in Wuhan, they have an Institute there that has over 1000 viruses…for what use????  Vaccines to makes us sick, if people could only use their common sense for a change we could bring Gates and other like him down. || Oscar Torres - Bell Gates, friend of Blood drinker Marina || Möhrchen - The biggest Killer all ovet the world is Gates! || Penelope Ryder - I am confused by the idea of certification we are all vulnerable and people must not be shamed life is precious.  Humans can be so full of themselves. See this history worst seems 75–200 million (10–60% of the European population) Europe, Asia and North Africa 1331–1353 Black Death Plague. COVID is on the bottom of the list .. I had the virus it for 28 days and not on the list as no test was available unless I was dying ... it is tragic when people think they are above other souls.  || James M - The Darwin Virus
The "" kindest solution""® || Spiros Delis - Since when Mr(?) Gates has become a medical expert ?( No comments for mr noone anderson ...)  Who gave you the right to act like god ? Why you think we are so stupid ? WHY ALL THESE POSTS ARE NOT MORE THAN 1 WEEK OLD  ? I was searching for a test of a 5g phone, and it is disappeared ... What do I need a  5g phone? I travel, and it could be useful to buy one , but the sudden disappearance of all the NEGATIVE posts, tell me that 5g IS NOT GOOD, and you ' ve just confirmed it. || Flying Up - You stepped down, Gates.

Having the time of his life hahhahaha || Vasya Vasilich - would be dope if he said ""i told you so"" at the beginning of the interview || Day that Fallows - Government wants to save economy, so no restrictions, but then they will have problem with virus and economy.. WHO CDC ? What is this was a deadly epidemic?? || djinvinceable - Totally dodged the “What was happening behind the scenes in January” question. Bill is no genius to point out that these types of pandemics are cyclical. || Vagrant Sneaker - Dont understand why people are referencing the Spanish Flu to COVID-19. SMH The reason we lost millions was because people were malnutrition. So, the virus attacked the weak people with bad immune systems. THATS THE FACT!!! We would have never lost more people in bunkers and front line if they had access to real food. Unfortunately, war does that. So, don't compare them to scare people, because thats why people are mentioning it.The reasons are far apart for why people die from the Spanish Flu and  COVID-19.r || MrArtist1971 - You've got to be kidding me. || John Levings - “Testing is everything “ || Mac - Gates is the biggest threat to our freedom and future.. || Patrick Rivard - Miss information at the highest level. Mr. Gates is misleading by stating a fatality rate that is not supported by the real numbers. || kcpkcp1000 - I think Chris Anderson failed his Maths and Science in high school otherwise he wouldn't ask such stupid questions. || Cory Thornton - Bill gates is a eugenicist || BOB HART - Ask your selves...""Who owns All Big Pharma?""

The greatness achievable through complementary partnership. || Anita Fernandez - 5G must be ILEGAL! || David Hudman - Zerohedge reports that the last sentence from his statement at 34:14 has been edited out:

""Eventually what we’ll have to have is certificates of who’s a recovered person, who’s a vaccinated person......Because you don’t want people moving around the world where you’ll have some countries that won’t have it under control, sadly. You don’t want to completely block off the ability for people to go there and come back and move around. So eventually there will be this digital immunity proof that will help facilitate the global reopening up.” || Shill Channel With Millions Of Other Identities - Beelzebub Gates || Flint Chikamyer - Did you ask him what he meant in this video about how he plans to use vaccine to reduce the population to Zero?

LoL || 엄준식은살아있다 - Is he a illuminati? || richpico - 34:14 says he wants people to have certificates? like your papers? or a tracking chip? || Tom Lakosh - The package shipping industry and grocers need disinfecting gloves infused with persistent antiviral solution, (Nanovapor?), that can kill most bugs before they could be transferred to another surface. All public transportation should dispense/sell and require N95 masks and eye protection to prevent rapid spread of disease over wide geographic areas. || Denis Yildirim - What’s funny??? || Anonny Maus - c19 is a #pLandemic || If You Can Keep It - You could fund all the ""work"" you desire.   I have no doubt you do. || 0MindSwept0 - Still waiting for proper courtesy measures to be implemented, when people cough all over everyone and everything they really shouldn’t wonder why stuff spreads like it does, and not doing so shouldn’t be such a novel concept for early prevention (epidemic or not). Diets play a role in this as well, and again, it leads one to wonder why the simplest solution’s aren’t the things that are first addressed 🤔 || Lizbeth Rodríguez - Bill Gates should said ""I told you so anyways..."" because he already talked about how to survive the next pandemic 5 years ago. || Tyler Fox - Yeah we need vaccines, not zinc, vit C and vit D3... just let us inject you || Suchit Das - Why NO-ONE tells you this: 
7,027   Deaths in Italy in 2013/14

Savage! 😎😂 || Carolyn Reynolds - You all are fighting toxic patriarchy that enforces toxic matriarchy that leads to epic proportions of ignorance || ellagraceable - He is sick! || Urban Bricks - Who else is here just to see of he says, ""I told you so""? || Gma K - What would make a tech think about a world involvement 5 whole years prior and why a virus and not food  or something else.

The year of the corona virus & the CENSUS. || Jordan Jordan - This genius can't even pronounce Remdesivir. || Kelli Tallow - He just wants to implement the mark of the beast and is the founder/creator of this virus. De population || Alexia Zins - it would be great if an osmosis jones type of movie where created so that everyone can understand why certain measures are necessary. Because preventing propagation is the key, and following specific processes for daily disinfection can change the outcome of the situation. The problem is there is not a good imaginative perception of the contagiousness. || Look Up - Alarm bells ringing mr gates, you ringing them? No doubt you are.

Reply:  I hear you, buddy.  If I'm in charge, this is what I would do:  

1..Absolutely quarantine all those at high risk like the elderly and those with chronic illnesses.    Have home delivery services to bring food and supplies to them.  Force them to wear location-tracking ankle bracelets  || Iyke King. - Depopulation strategy. || Timothy Vaughn - How would he have known of this in particular before hand? || Sean Padraig O'Brien - They left out the part about the digital certificate for vaccines to get the world up and running again. || John Wiltshire - min 33:47 wow. Wake up people. And for those who say use context int his same interview he admitted at min 3:49-min 4:53 that  the corona virus was not as fatal as SARS etc and most people recover from covid
“You wrote that this could be the once-in-a-century pandemic that people have been fearing. Is that how you think of it, still?” queried Anderson. || Shane Watkins - Bill CANT TALK about the lost month of Feb as its a Possible time Bomb of discovery. The CCP had been and was Spreading the Virus around the world fast and spreading mis information at the same time which helped the spread. || Michael Richards - Of course we should ""blame"". 

The virus started in Wuhan, a chinese province, by escaping from a chinese govt run level 2 research facility. The first people to contract and spread the virus were chinese.  || dreams - Dear Mr. Gates, what is so funny? Would you like to share the reason behind your constant laughter and giggling with the masses too? (Explanation in words only will suffice, Mr. Gates.) || duty paid - well we know who all his friends are. || enrico napolitano - this virus pandemic is actually obviously man made intentional and not just a coincidence || enrico napolitano - this virus pandemic is actually obviously man made intentional and not just a coincidence || TheMegadethMonk - EDITED VIDEO TO HIDE TRUE MOTIVES : At 34:14 : ""Eventually what we’ll have to have is certificates of who’s a recovered person, who’s a vaccinated person […] Because you don’t want people moving around the world where you’ll have some countries that won’t have it under control, sadly.

No steel toe capped boots, lack of gloves on some people, no hard hats, no safety specs.  Staying Safe does not just involve the Corona Virus! || mans410 - There are at least 10 time more people infected that the ones that has been testes do the mortality is 10 less and the intensive care cases are more or less the same because all of those cases are tested in hospitals. || PinUpEarrings dot com Handmade - Bill doesn't have a great MIND ~ he has a toxic mind ~ he has a great bank balance ~ THAT IS HIS REWARD. So much DUPING DELIGHT going on it makes my head spin! Especially when he talks about THE NEXT PANDEMIC. When he says that they will get the vaccine out to everyone he is REVEALING that a vaccine does exist and it was only distributed to the 1% || popas7 - It's all very funny to the ""philanthropist"" who thinks there are too many people on this planet. Body language doesn't lie. || Arnieus - In 2017 Fauci said ""there will be a surprise outbreak"". Now he is pushing billion dollar deals with Bill here for mandatory vaccines with digital tracking. If you still think this virus came from China you are bat soup crazy. || Frank Maitland - Bill ""we certainly "" didn't take advantage of Feburary || Ronald Van Beneden - Is Bill Gates here revealing the real reason behind the lockdowns and corona? Who holds a patent for the corona virus?

I live in Branson Missouri, We had a soul pass yesterday,  he was in the hospital for something else. upon his death they did a covid test which cam out positive. The nurses were not wearing ppe because the supply is low, and they thought the guy was safe . now we have a situation where 50+ nurses and other medical staff have been exposed.

Plus now from WHO website US has biggest infection rate of any other country in the world closing in on 240,000 probably over that as the stats are not live updated. || richpico - 33:45 "" We don't want to have a lot of recovered people "" || Souls Happy - This guy has been warning us for years!

I don't know one person laughing or smiling about it. || jaanko jennings - The public would like to know the vaccine schedule that Bill & Melinda Gates used for their children. This question remains unanswered after many years.

Does he know he has a massive covid 19 particle in the room with him || Tyson Smith - By remembering we will all die and face the dread judgment. || mans410 - When vaccinated from the flu they take all the information(race include) first, and then, they go inside and choose the vaccine wright for you."

Can't wait. || Arantyr DarkHand - This party looks like a dumpster fire... no one like each oter, everyone its mad about the whole situation.... I LOVE IT. || Philipp Gabain von Kries - I don't think I'll ever watch another CEO play his own game on stream. Swen Vincke is one of a kind. || Jason - ""Devils, dragons, mind flayers...they used to be abstracts...pictures on a piece of paper.""
I see what you did there. || Goddamnitiwantaname - ""You get you rest, I'll stand watch.""
lies down with the whole party || JDB - IMO, that was a masterclass in pulling off an authentic and likable gameplay demonstration, bugs and all. Personally I couldn't be happier with the choice of studio. || Rens Smetsers - switches to human in the dark basement ""ugh, can't see a thing"" switches back to half elf. that was hilarious. || Almarane - My headcanon : 4 Godwokens are playing a campaign of D&D5 while traveling on the Lady Vengeance between acts with Malady as the GM. || Tacet - Seven minutes in and I'm already impressed. The dialogue issue was one that was important to me, and they listened to feedback and fixed it. This is why I've got a ton of respect for Larian; they don't seem fixated on their own vision of the games they make like some other developers, and they're usually better games for it. || Andrew Vaaler - I’m very new to D&D and recently started playing Divinity 2. Can’t believe what I’ve been missing.

And now, seeing who is in charge of making these games, love and respect it even more. || Caevyc Kelmaris - ""Go for the eyes, Boo. GO FOR THE EYES! RrraaaAAGHGHH!"" || Ishla Corrin - Falling into the Underdark then dying instantly is basically how the Underdark works. I was not disappointed. || Papaya Power - One part of me really wants to watch this, the other one wants to play spoiler free.
It's a rough battle. || Alkatsojo - Getting mad dragon age vibes from the camp module. || Noneya Business - I could watch Swen play this all day long.  His honesty about glitches and bugs is very refreshing.  I'm so ready to lose a long portion of time when this comes out.  Is there an official release date yet? || iconocast - oh my, the verticality. the options look so good! wonder if they will add a grapple || 5chr4pn3ll - This video in one sentence: ""Oh no, what did I do?!"" || TheOne5 - She let the kids get away, where is Goblin slayer when you need him?! || Luke - This looks so awesome. The fact that the head of Larian studios plays his own games and is a actual gamer is what sets this studio above all the others imo. || H D - The special effects on non-magical attacks need to go. They look really silly and out-of-place, and diminish the visual impact of actual spells. || Pedro Felipe - Man, that speedrun at the end. || Travis Smith - The way they are implementing dark vision is sooooo cool. Exactly how I would imagine it in a DnD campaign || Sam Wise - Honestly, it's stuff like this that makes me like Larian more than most other gaming studios. The upfront honesty about how this is a very early build with glitches and unpolished mocap and the interaction with the live chat are brownie points in my book. || piet kargaard - What i love the most is the abillity to mess up but still have an enjoybale time,  no need for save scumming, really looking forward to this. || Zanite - ""Watches Swen's party get hit by a fireball"" Now you know what my DoS 2 playthrough was like! || GRRAB - I've had a hard time committing to big games lately but this is gonna be an immediate buy || Eduardo Verdeja - Oh god we are all hyped af
Sven and Larian - amazing job. I love how upfront you are! || softshoes - Don't you just love it when your saving throw is a four and you roll a two. ||  - The excell spreadsheet in my head of all the permutations is making me drrrrrooooool || UnclePutte - You know, there should be a ""ooh can I ride too"" option for the conversation with the gobbos at around 21:00. || But it do - I'm so happy they trusted Larian to make this, such a great developer. || BoxingKoala - The large hands on the goblins and gnomes is ... Unsettling. || Jack Marsk - I absolutely love the level design in this game so far. The use of verticality is great to utilize in the video game medium, as it's used much less often in the tabletop format of 5e (for obvious reasons, harder and less visually appealing to establish height without investing a lot of money in terrain/buildings/etc). In addition, being able to use the environment in creative ways in combat (Using Firebolt on a spider web to make a spider on it fall to the ground and take damage? That's the shit I like) as well as being able to use objects in the environment for exploration are great (Stacking boxes to make a makeshift platform to reach a higher ledge? Amazing) and I honestly can't wait to explore this world. || Ritchie R - I’d love to see a DLC for this game where Matt Mercer voices the DM/Narrator || TheOuterLimits - With this game and SOLASTA crown of the magister coming out; its a great time for dnd lover like my self with no frends. || Reav - Ah man I need to do my typical evil playthrough, now I need to do a second playthrough where I give in to the tadpole, annnd a playthrough where I side with Raphael. || Da Ne - This game is DND incarnate, all these possibilities of messing up and around really gives a feeling of the real table top experience. Also I am super happy that Amelia is the narrator this time, loved her as Malady. || Eurrikke Edward - the sound effect is damn amazing and really gives every action that extra epic oomf || Andrew Jackson - 15:35 ""you gotta be kidding me"". Dev wants to rage and buff his own game. This is a good sign. || friedipar - I realy like the sneaking animation! It´s such a small detail, but they realy pulled it off in a way that is actualy noticeable || Rejic - I do hope that succumbing to becoming an illithid is an actual option. || five21 - Does Swen's character look like him a little or am I crazy? :D || Smurph yalae - Game looks fantastic. I do hope they tone down the punchyness of spells respective to their level. Knock should be a subtle click of the fingers or even better a simple wrap of the knuckles on the chest. I fully expect fire ball to be an arm flailing thumper but lighting a torch seems overly dramatic || Chris Upper - Looks great so far. Watching this makes we want to play Baldur's Gate 1. || ValiantShadow Games - Jesus, this looks incredible. Can't wait for the Early Access to start! || Johnny Sizemore - Just hope this is for PS4 cause i can't afford 5 yet...... || Dominic Accurso - Mind Flayers are the only thing that scared the shit out of me in D&D || renatus1024 - 10 minutes of stream spent satisfying a foot fetish...love it, cant wait for release! || Eric Prout - I can't wait, I'm just as exited for this game as I am for cyberpunk. || Andy Heathcote - My favourite thing about this is his bag on the floor behind him.. reminds me of rushing home excited to play a game, getting in and throwing down my bag to jump straight on the computer! :) Cannot WAIT to play this. || Thundaarr - I love his acceptance... ""I know you're just gonna pick under dark so I'm heading back now"" || Risax - Saw some cute Goblin games before, was already on board before but I'm definitely getting it on Early Access now! (Also because all of the other cool stuff, I guess. Keep up the good work, folks! :P) || Erik Malkavian - 29:45  That's a Demon or Devil (Knew it straight off) || Nick Didato - I know I'm gonna be on the character creator for 40 hours making every single character concept I've made for the game. || Grant Krick - 10:50 it's Johnny all the way from Crookback Bog! ||  - Looks great but you guys should have recorded while you were live streaming that way you could upload what was streamed with the best quality instead of the bitrate going to hell. I do the same and my recording always looks 100x better than the vod || Hunter Burchett - The Baldurs gate series has been one of my favorites for a long time,  I can't wait to get my hands on it. || Dior King - I love how I knew what the skills did before they were used because of the divinity influence || Nero Lightning Lynx - Thank you so much for changing the dialogue to present tense and first person! Wow these guys really have my respect. || MegaBatMan MegaMan - All I wanna say is thank you for blessing us with such High Quality D&D game. || thousandyoung - Can't wait to make my evil sarcastic female drow cleric || Tagan Reaper - 10:28 is that Jaime fookin Lannister? || Cody Jones - Hey guys love the look of the game, and wonder if it is planned to be released on console? || Hannes Visagie - The best games are the ones where you can watch gameplay without getting bored. This looks like a winner. || Hawkwinter01 - Loving the changes since February, and I'm getting hyped for this game. 😎 || Justin Krone - Fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu I have a mighty need for this! Been missing a new game from Larian Studios! Your work is so amazing! The wife and I just love your games! || ManlyPicnics - Really like what I'm seeing, as an avid D&D player, definitely picking this up. || Ash Liz - It was so amazing watching this, I would watch any videos of Sven playing honestly, most charming CEO Ive ever seen. I was stressed right along with him when he was racing to get to the...end part he was aiming for. Awesome video, awesome company, awesome game.  Cannot wait to see more of this. || The Casual Longsword - Uh, why do you power up to do every action? 

Why are there still floating 2 handed weapons on the back in 2020... || deadtreebark - The gods demand this game brings plenty of adventurers to slay. || Cosmic cowboy - This is definitely the most true to dnd video game ever looks amazing can’t wait || Abyssal - I don’t think I’ve ever clicked on an add faster~ || Soldat Boga - The sound is amazing! Love the game play features too! Can't wait for this || Elder Dragon - Hi, sir from Laurian Studios. I am really happy about what I am seeing. I know that the game needs to improve and be polished, so I would ask you, if the game will have a food&drink system, because I like that survival aspect in D&D. Thank you for any attention you could give to this topic. (I see that the character received food as items, but will they have any need during the game, like starve, for example?) || bawlsackin Harry - I’ve actually gotten excited about playing games after watching this review. I’ve been pretty disappointed in gaming for several years. I see some opportunities to improve with mouth movements and giving the characters audio for a users selected response, but overall pretty excited. || Kevin Taylor - The game looks awesome, I can't wait!  Great writing, characters and gameplay... fantastic job!!  Come on early access!!!!! || shield of faith - Can't wait for them to release the early access version, hopefully soon. 
Also: you must gather your party before venturing forth... || Gargantuan Perpetrator - The starting segment at the camp reminded me of Dragon Age Origins so much. I can't wait to get my hands on this game. || Matt Aster - I love how the fighter was stealthing around in clunky heavy armor :) || Pest 138 - Looking forward to this game.:-) || JeaHSaren - damn, watching this is just making me want this more, and I already wanted it last week. || Justin King - this game is looking great, I just got into DnD with a couple friends b4 u know what hit, and i'm looking forward to playing this game. || Filip Agrippa - The animations still need a lot of work, but damn, I like what I'm seeing here. It's shaping up to be amazing. || Marcus Hicks - That fight with the Goblins reminds me of a few combats I've recently had in Divinity: Original Sin ;). || Eyjafjallajökull - ""you must gather your party before venturing forth"" || IqarP15 - When doing choice dialogue make sure characters npcs etc do blink and breathe. || Scott Schultz - Swen's voice sounds like he's asking for ransom. || Matt Lang - Oh my god this game looks amazing. || Muhammad Pandu - Ok I love that the slash/hit effects look and feel good. This is really what most cRPGs tend to de-prioritize. || Hunter May - the lore behind this video is amazing! their keeping it forgotten realm, the kaiths againts the mind flyaers. omg i may have peed some on seeing that. || Ezra - Some of the spell animations are a little extra lol.. Just ""getting ready to jog slightly faster"" creates a huge WHOOM and blows the leaves back hahaha || WaLLy - I would have hoped your character would also talk like in Dragon age  Inquisition and Divinity 2. That was cool. Mabey. || Roid-Monger 101 - This, demon souls, and Elden ring are going to keep me entertained for decades || davin smith - when he looted that chest with knock, steelforged sword..........yeah i got excited over 1D6 +1 piercing ....shoot me || Michi Bichi - this game looks so amazing. thank you larian! cant wait to get my hands on it. || Fuvity - I can't believe the game already looks this good || Captain Knots - Can not wait for this game I just recently started playing DOS2 and it's a great game. Only wish I would've played it sooner. 

Just want to say the transparency to us (the playerbase) from Larian studios about their game is a breath of fresh air. Awesome awesome awesome job guys! || minemaime - The music after raphael showed reminds me so much of gaunter o'dimm's theme. I wonder if it's on purpose. It'd be such a cool easter egg! || Xenellia - Omg, thank you SO much for changing the dialogue! The first person thing was super weird to me, this is miles better! Really looking forward to this game's final release :D || Monikan Cultist - You know the way the perspective is presented at the beginning reminds me of Dragon Age 1 || disky - 44:19 one minute is 8 rounds? That's weird, shouldn't it be 6? || Feardemon - This game looks, sounds and plays amazing! Cannot wait! || wulfgar88 - - ""THE SQUEAKY WHEEL GETS THE KICK!"" || eric dietz - Take your time, just make sure it works! Great to see it's coming along! || Jinnath - I can't wait to get this :)
The mindflayers are the scariest enemies ever. || Ki Li - Looks nice i love that its similar to divinity. Really excited ^^ || Vanvorqs - I love Swen. Makes this so much better, and it's already amazing. || Dan Allard - I love it Swen, keep it up! Great to see you got my feedback about the use of 3rd person in dialogue options and switched it to 1st person. 😜 Next thought...why did it look like you were camped outside when you were resting in the cave near the end of the stream? Is that going to be default resting animation no matter where you are or what time of day it is? It'd be great if you set it up so that resting is dynamic based on your environment and time of day. Keep up the amazing work! Can't wait to get my hands on it! || rosey tone - I’m only a few minutes into the gameplay, and just seeing the spells being casted is getting me extremely hyped. || Phillip - I want to be able to couch co op an action RPG like Dark Alliance and such in the PS2 days. Know most people prefer these turn based RPGs and I love them too; but I want some more Diablo like games I can play with friends. Turn based ones don't work as well for that I find.
This game looks amazing though, just it reminds me of what I miss is all. || The Cyber Satyr - In addition to my other comment, it seems like raid: shadow legends stole the assets for their orcs from this || ARTiSTAR - it looks awesome i love that theres a ton of options and the world feels big i hope it is! ive thought of such a concept of a game with simpler physics(or graphics) but with endless options and thats the closest ive seen to this concept. Amazing work, looking forward to it and the next stream too! || Jay Sands - I really love the way the skill rolls and slowing down the movement to enhance the use of each characters spells and abilities. The storyline looks promising and looks like it could be brought to even higher levels if you guys have the resources to continue adding to the possible story branch dialogues and branches. I will certainly be getting the early access as I've been waiting for this particular D&D sequel for over two decades! Such love for the D&D books from the original tabletop game. Hope you include a Dungeon Master mode with lots of assets to build modules we can share! Love what you guys have done so far. || Max2ds - I like how the guy who greets you in a hostile manner is actually the nicest to you once you get talking || The Exclusive Corner - Great video. The game is looking amazing and I can't wait to play it. I love your presentation and you looked like you were enjoying it a lot. I also love how you were talking about the bugs you came across and that it's still being developed. A genuine stream and I thank you guys for making this game with passion. || Jackie J - Not gonna lie, I'm not feeling much of this voice acting, especially for that.. gremlin? imp? It still looks like it'll be a lot of fun though. || Nobody Important - I will make it my goal to throw everyone and everything off of high ground. || Anthony Thompson - That goblin sounds like voice actor who did Johnny in The Witcher 3 || D L S - I cant wait to sink hours/days/years into this game. || Fankas2000 - I really like the sneaking animations. || Wes Anderson - Wow, finally.  Now this gonna take yrs to port. Lmao || Mike Wright - Love the more agile combat, how everyone get the different movement abilities like dash, jump etc for free and the addition to push people. Will make for some interesting strategies. || Cameron Larsen - i wonder how warlock and cleric work with entities that give them power. || Gustavo D'Andrea - Thanks for the overview! It looks amazing! I love to have Malody as the narrator! || Jackie Mason - something i noticed from this, when your wizard casts misty step and then thunderwave in the same turn, i'm happy to see that! a RAW rule that i almost always modify or ignore is that if you cast a spell with your bonus action, the only spell you can cast with your action is a cantrip. but it really opens up so many cool combos for casters like sorcerers or clerics who have great bonus action options, so i usually tweak or ignore that rule anyway. it balances itself decently well just because you're burning through resources faster, though sometimes i'll use a variant on the rule that you can only cast one spell of 3rd level or higher with either your action or bonus action per turn. either way, point is, glad to see that kind of thing'll be possible here!! i LOVE clerics and quickened spell sorcerers for just that reason when i'm playing in groups that use similar houserules. it's a minor thing to be excited for, i know, but it's got me so hyped all over again! || Jake Walter - I can allready see it.
Time in game: 2000 hours || Ty Fletcher - Multiple endings are a must for this, imo. || Rebecca Pitts - It's so cool to see D&D portrayed with these kinds of graphics. Looking forwards to this game immensely, and hoping that at some point we are given some kind of adventure maker for making our own NPC's/adventures! :D || Johny Shadow - Oh wow, this came out on my birthday. How did I miss it? Nevermind, best late present! :D || TwoSwordsOneGun - A lot of baddies look like they're in need of an uppercut! Can't wait! || Andrew Berkemeyer - Everyone keeps whining over a level 10 cap and honestly I see no issue with that, if the main campaign's villain is a mind flayer or even an ulitharid, both are under CR 10 which means that with a level 10 party of probably 2 spellcasters and 1-2 fighters/ meat-shields and a dps guy or two. So if you can go and grind out a level or two without the cap you and your party are suddenly able to cast 6th level spells, attack three times in a turn and do ridiculous amounts of damage in a single turn which can wreck any kind of Mindflayer in a few rounds. Also, the power of a high level characters makes any encounter trivial so it is no issue for me || Mcfly - Uff! Thank you for changing the initiative system!! || David. T - EgnyteHQ - I'd rather it diablo immortal became diablo: immortal. If you catch my drift. || Jesse Houser - The goblins remind me of the orcs from Shadow of Mordor/ War and it takes me back || Victor Zavala - Seems really cool! I've never really played d&d, but I might give this a try || K1NG o L3GEND - Never would I have thought I would be here watching this. Enjoyable. || Mr. Blutarsky - Needs an adventure builder. You could d/l other player's adventures and campaigns || David - This game looks amazing. i love the dice rolling mechanics. I typically do not like turn based games but this looks different. its very in depth unlike most. I am intrigued. || Khwam Tay - I can't wait, been waiting to long for this. Baldurs gate is the best game ever. || Nspinicelli - The voice acting and sound engineering is fantastic! I can't wait! || beastmaster415 - I'm not playing it unless Sleyvas is in it or my character tells me ""Can't carry anymore""....🤣😂... Only the real know || Twisted Tentacle Inn - You're going to have to find a way to release this game by the end of the month. I just can't wait until the end of the year!

- Innkeeper Vase Odin || John - Loved BG2 back in the day. I can still remember some of the voices like Jaheira screaming “Fall, creature, and feed the Earth!” || Mike Watts - Looks great, can't wait to play! However, I have one question. What happened to the goblins? Their skin tone is way  off, it is supposed to be green. || Francisc Kovacs - You guys should absolutely be proud; this is some stellar work you're showing us here. The whole thing just oozes passion, it's fantastic to see ! also, Sven should guest on Critical Role at some point (if he hasn't already, still catching up xD ) || Jiss Nunes - omg those perceptions rolls feels so good
But i dont wanna see the failed ones, tho. || TheCynicsCynic - Swen is so into this game and energized, I love it.  Also that old video of him being devious at D&D headquarters is hilarious. || Mikeztarp - This looks so fun! I've never seen a game with so many possibilities. :) || joaquin vega - in my goblin slayer run, im gonna get those kids, and ALL the goblins || Viper 4115 - This game will be amazing! Also number 1 rule of DnD, don’t split the party!!! Yet he did it fairly well lol. || Nelson Baietti - You've made me clap enthusiastically.
I have a clapper connected to the only light in my living room and it is turning on and off, but you deserve it!!!
clap!!! clap!!! clap!!! clap!!! clap!!! clap!!! clap!!! clap!!! || Thomas Donovan - Looks interesting, looking forward to it! || Mumumumu - I'm really happy with the changes they have made from the last live demo! || Andreas O - When Raphael appeared I thought for a moment his face was modeled after Peter Cushing || Oto Kage - that combat looks like so much fun, and the magic and lightning is awesome. Also the interactivity... 
To give some feedback, I would put physics on those flocks of hair Shadowheart has at the sides of the face, she looks just odd. And also improve the teeth of those goblins and monsters, I mean it looks weird that all have such white and perfectly aligned teeth, even if some have razor sharp teeth they look too clean lol. || Jolly Voqar - Overall looks pretty amazing but I don't like how often he switches to just one character - much prefer full party everything except maybe some scouting.  But, he was probably don't that in the interest of time.

Really like the expansive and detailed environments that don't feel like flat maps. || william lyell - Ok I'm greedy, no player Illithid or Ulithard either. Really?? One of my favorite characters was an Ulithard Psionicist. || Kyle Segnitz - Amazing looking game from an amazing studio. Keep up the great work. Hoping for ps5 release so the wife and I can play coop || Matt Lang - 29:30 Lord Farquaad has entered the game. || Andrew A - Hope we can do the underdark and goblin camp. I want all the xp and loot, I need it. || Dan Roberts - Absolutely charming performance from the Svirfneblin voice actor! I especially loved him saying ""Magga Cammara!"" (Svirfneblin for ""By the stones!"" for anyone who doesn't know); a nice little nod to Belwar Dissengulp from the Drizzt Do'urden series. This game was clearly made by people who love the lore. || KrazyPieThief - Mind flayers? Man, this campaign is going to start off high level.

my entire party is level 3 || Daggorth - Oh, thank Tyr! I’m glad to see dialogue options written in present tense.
I personally felt that having dialogue options which were merely descriptions of what the PC says robbed dialogue of some of its personality. || Lane Gaming - Hey guys! Wouldn't it be great if B.G 3 had a similar combat system to the first 2!? Instead of a 30 minute pause for every single battle, every single action!? Guys? Guys!!!!???? || Tony F. - I still can't get over how amazing that intro cinematic is... || Ahhh Media - Im never impressed anymore but that wad great.  Thank you for providing quality games. || Lane Gaming - ...2 and a half hours later... so I finally finished my first action in the first battle. What? Fast paced combat mechanics? Wait, you actually can move your fingers faster than a snail? But the rest of the gamers... they just... they cant... thats why we implemented this choice-based combat system! So people who can't play a combative game can finally attempt to! What? The nostalgic fans of B.G 1 and 2? Nahhh, they won't care that we gutted the combat system. Nahhh. || Aborin - Wow,that's look amazing! So you could play as a Mind flayer in theory? || Dapper Changeling - One thing I hope they've improved from DOS2 is how multiplayer deals with dialog. It really sucked having it just be 'one person talks while the others tand around like gormless idiots, beholden to the first person to get a conversation.' || MGCXIII - wow this looks amazing so far :D || Cythil - Ooo... that is my favourite spelljammer ship in the intro! || Norbert Caillet - It seems Malady is our narrator this time around. Lovely! :) The verticality is incredible. || Arhatu - I like games with class spessific items, changing equipment from  one character to another is not fun. || Sylvius the Mad - This is the game I have been waiting for all my life.  This one.

Step aside Ultima IV.  You might be about to be dethroned. || James Catchot - The game looks and sounds amazing.  Casting spells comes across and a very powerful action.  Love it. || Obsidian Dwarf - Okay. Loving what I see. Can't wait. BUT, I just gotta say, do I scent the merest whiff of a flying lizard of indeterminate years? || Logen M - Now if only Bethesda games were this upfront and honest about their games with players. || Williams Duran - 3 minutes in and I’m lost asf but the game looks so beautiful and I want it. || That One Dude - Don't have time to watch the whole thing, but the intro looks great, looks like a githyanki vs mindflayer war or something
I wonder which edition of D&D this will use || Austin McGinley - I luved dark alliance 1 and 2 and now we get this omg 2020 looking up || Gobblin' Goblin - 44:55 Rolls natural 20 on the jump, rolls a 2 on the landing. || The Sedrick Channel - I NEED THIS IN MY VEINS NOW!!!! || A Guy - They nailed the demon I will give them that.I hope they can change enough of the gameplay to separate it from being divinity 3. || Jakub Kotyza - first dnd 5E game, I cant hardly wait :) || VStormV Bringer - Looking great! Maybe you can make a dramatic close up camera angle when a wizard is summoning or something like that || Mihály Kerékgyártó - The game looks insanely fun. The only thing I am a bit conflicted is the low level cap. Would have loved using those high level spells. Maybe there will be an expansion later. || MarshmallowMadnesss - Please tell me Sven voices some NPC himself? I'd like to hear his accent in the game. Not to mention, the love he has for this project is front and center. || tdsil - If a developer has that much of a challenge playing this game, I can’t imagine what my playthroughs are going to be like || Victor Purificação - 46:15 so you can play as Drax in this game huh || Mgreyskull's Studio - Dude!!! I cannot wait for August to be playing this game! I've been having dnd withdrawls and this seems to fit the bill. Are all races going to be in the game such as changelings and warforged? || PrsnllJebus - I’ve suffered the nine hells themselves! || Logan Ross - 3:14 notice the dead squidhead.  I guess the story is they are low on numbers, dying off, and are harvesting hosts to avoid extinction. || Brandon Johnson - I never got into DOS2, but this looks incredible. || Andros Forever - I CAN'T WAIT! This is #1 on my most anticipated list!! || Balázs Pataki - The game overall looks really damn excellent, but I hope they do something with the camping, because it's just weird and immersion breaking that we're in the Underdark and we suddenly teleport to a different location just to rest. || M Money - Hell yes! It’s about damn time! || Lex_Ka - When's the release date ?

In gonna buy this even if it's shit , baldurs 2 was my childhood.. but I hope it's good . || Mike Clement - This looks absolutely gorgeous! || ohNo231 - Is it just me or does the gnome look almost exactly like Swen? || Alec Gunson - God this game is going to be so good || Laila Harris - I know this from stranger things :> || Ji Cottrill - I'm super excited for 2025 when I can afford to buy a new computer to play this! XD || Roberson Cassol - Awesome job guys for now! 

Can't wait =) || Caridos - the main guy look so derpy XD
the game look amazing || Scott Adams - Great there's a bug in my brain and it wants to turn me into a squid monster || Jordan - The thumbnail looks like Satan from SMT || JoeSchmo - You're all doing an awesome job making this game and presenting it! || Minka Lampinen - Goblin kids! Is that a first? What adorable little menaces XD Seriously, I love the fact that goblins aren't just things you can/must kill in this game. I wonder how they'll react to a drow character? || JAIME GARCIA - I wish this game was coming out this month or sooner.  I'm dying to play a good single player RPG. || karsten69 - you know what would be awesome paid dlc for this? 

map creator. || Inu Ghost - So sad that I couldn't watch all of this. Had to make phone calls during the last 30 minutes of the presentation. || mrbirdlick - man, this looks amazing || Rashon Burnett - I love them as a studio. They are so awesome. I can’t wait to play this game. || Stephen Michael - Looks like it will be an amazing game! I hope that we will be able to change the games low level darkness to handicap you so you have to use night vision or torches. || persiangangster - nice game, love how he played, much fun!!! || baphnie - 11:20 trying to enter CHAZ || TheMastaphobia - Volo is a lot younger looking than I expected. || Plasma Phi - Part of the Original Credit goes to Howard Phillips Lovecraft. || Gryphon2026 - Does anybody know if they have released the names of the voice actors for BG3 ?
I just know I recognize most of the voices in the game that I've heard so far anyway, and I just want to know for sure lol || Merlin Fourever - Camaraderie, Adventure, and steel on steel.  The stuff of legends!  Right, Boo? 🤪 || DJ North - Looks just awesome, bugs and all. So many ways to do things. Really looking forward to the final product. || MrPaion - 30:10
lord farquaad?! || DeDarkwood - I love the soundtrack after and during devil encounter. Composer is on point. || Danny G - This is insane, thank you || The Mic of Mike - This looks incredible. PLEASE tell me there will be some level of co-op!? || Nelson Baietti - I really love the actors!!! || Tom Elliott - Sold, take my money. || Jbshbs Skskhbs - Unfair that we get to see this and then have to wait months to play ourselves! || TheSkullPanda - Looks great, lots of promising visuals and mechanics!  I'm particularly impressed but also curious about the platforming / moving objects and furniture around in game.  It's a little jarring having the wizard just pick up and throw crates, i wonder if that animation could be tweaked to be a little more immersive (pushing/dragging)? Regardless, it has a lot of possibilities, from hiding treasure under a bed to Zelda style puzzles.  It seems like there's a focus on making the game world very interactive, and I LOVE this.  I remember for decades having to stop at an arbitrary barrier like a cliff edge or short wall, but this shows them clearly getting over or climbing those obstacles.  Climbing up on roofs reminds me of some of the best tactical RPGs, even though the game clearly has a focus on story and role play as well.   || jrock 9430 - Dear Larian, Please make a Paizo Starfinder (Sci-Fantasy) game!  I'm all-in for a Larian Starfinder-esq RPG kickstarter!! || AJCrowley0153 - I'm so happy they changed the dialogues || Fletcher Bach - It looks amazing! || Emile Coetzee - I can't wait to see how they animate divine smite || SinisterKieran - amazing, i cannot friggin wait!!!! || Andrej Jovanovic - I love grafic and gameplay and that devil speach was awesome i hope story in game will be great and even beter from newerwinter from 2000"" || Cesar Rivera - The game looks great I can't wait to play it but I do wish the colors where less saturated. Maybe someone will make a mod that will change it. || Hotwheelz_McG - Is it just me or are all the hands and fingers on all the characters a bit long or oversized? || PichuLord - Looks great. Looking forward to it! || k74FF - ""If we should meet again...well, we will have met again""

Love some snarky gnome dialogue, can't wait for this to come out. || lonewolf1868 - Missed opportunity to put a brake to the windmill in the wrong angle and leave the gnome screaming. || M Green - No way! Now I’ll never get out of my moms basement! || Halott Ember - WAIT ! There’s a Balder’s Three !  YAY !!! || Quentin Gray - I hope they change how ya hold the greatsword, looks a bit odd. || Landry - Looks interesting, but it reminds me more of of DOS2 or Dragon Age than BG. I don't see myself playing any kind of evil with this beautiful and shiny setting. Anyway they're still working on it I guess || TetraZeta - This.....this is the game I've been wanting for years.  Like mass effect and xcom had a freaking super baby. || Flippwn - 11:08 Oh hey its Johnny from Witcher 3! || iamisandisnt - OK I take it back, this looks really cool. || Agmundr Fontenot - Is it just me or does the goblin's and deep gnome's hands seem far too large? || AzureRoxe - Honestly, i really do hope they ultimately voice the character options. It seems really strange to see everything voiced EXCEPT for those moments. || Jeremiah - I'm exited! BG3 is looking awesome and I can't wait to play! || Avatar - The magic looks great, but the animations could usee a little work in the dialog tree. And a little bit more contrast and less strength in global lighting. || Heidevolk le Gueux - Is that the new Neverwinter MMO / DDO ? || Wow Really? - I watched my brother and father play the original two on initial release. 
Years later I just can’t get into those two. So hopefully my bauldurs experience begins here as I love dnd. || Numuhukumakiaki aialunamor - These magic animations are beautiful! ||  - i´m so glad that it feels so much like Divinity. Defenitely will spend too much time on this game :D || Baraz - Shadowheart's wise and somewhat ""paranoid"" (testing the main character) interactions were cool !  I like her : those conversations do succeed at creating a feeling of friendship or bonding.  nice work || Vital Vector - It's fascinating seeing how much more interaction we can have with every being we come across. In BG 1+2, if you see a goblin, you kill the goblin. This is so much more nuanced. I could see myself spending HOURS talking to every being I come across. This also shows how important Charisma is in this game. Again in BG 1+2, charisma was considered a ""throw-away"" stat for many characters except a few. I can see myself building very different characters with this game. || S4LTKING - God, this made me so hyped || James3790 - Hope this isn't as hard as divinity 2. Just took too long to do anything, got tired after a while. || ShyBoy_Savage - I loved Baulders gate on pc back in the day!! || Nairo Camilo - ""But it is real... We've seen it...""
Oh, does this takes place after the Descent into Avernus module book? || TheJerbol - Okay this got me the MOST hyped for the game || Aaron schoenberger - So when's the switch port coming out || Sandus - so excited about this game :D || jared chappell - This is amazing!!! || a smooth brained ape - This looks amazing but please fix the hand size on the little characters so I can take them seriously. || I Click Like - goblin voice feels off. hope it is still being worked on. would like some pitch adjustment. || Mark Bishop - I am looking forward to this game! This is the best way to sell a new game. This and lets plays by players. || Brian Haley - Looks like you can cast both a bonus action and action spell in the same turn. Looks amazing though can't wait! || Sean O'Daniel - The narrator voice, is that the same person who voiced Malady in DOS2? It sounds familiar. || Patrick Ran - 首发请出中文，谢谢！
Really want to play this game so much! || Kalebe Alves - 20:36 what about the looting? || Fufuneraire - I'm really waiting for this game. I'll buy it. I like your job. But seeing this video, I still hate the balance capacity of Larian. 
""lalala first fight, did it several times, my team dies, but NO PROBLEM"" :v 
This is DnD. I hope we'll also have ""light"" fights. || Eric - For shame on him he SPLIT the party! Hes also mixing player knowledge with character knowledge Again for SHAME! || Daniel Vickers - Is there going to be a day/night cycle? Or is time of day based on the area and location? || Rob Leonard - Phenomenal gameplay...can't wait!! || LastSider - or how I didnt liked divinity and now we are getting the third installment. || Abdülkadir Dursun - Now i will jump down from every hole i see :D || Daniel M - This looks really good. This and Cyberpunk will have my attention. Other devs better step up. || Ckbtony 1983 - I've been waiting for this all week || ** - no one wants to see a goblin face so close to their screen || Mikeztarp - I hope there's an option to make the dice rolls automatic. At first glance, I like that it reminds me of tabletop D&D, but I think the extra click and animation time will get tiresome, and some people won't like it at all. || Ironborn BTW - Why does it sound like he is skipping ahead every 2 seconds? || LordKKs - OMG THIS GAME LOOKS SO AWESOME! || Andrzej Tucholski - 46:20 cannot wait for having moments like this one :D || Colpik - I sent you a quantum loop ! you can do it !! thank's || Gokki77 - I hope there as as epic good music in this game as in Divinity 2. That game had really good music || Valthalin - Oh yeah, Sven and the other Devs as the virtual DM is going to be classic Dungeons and Dragons. I can see it in his body language when he talks about what a player can choose to do in game. I love how he knows he is going to the Underdark no matter what. You can almost see him thinking ""Thanks R.A. Salvatore, i can't even tempt them away even after all these years since your work."" || theusernameicoodfind - I mean I love divinity 2 so I just think larian is gonna do a good job on this title || Vladimir Tchuiev - All the interactions give me a strong Dragon Age Origins vibe. Honestly I like that. || Chuck Graham - Divinity original sin gameplay. Looks good. || CallOfDrewthulhu - Remember when charge-up glowing and spectral particles meant you were a magician doing some magic, rather than ""getting ready to run fast?"" I blame anime. Hardly a dealbreaker, and I will still buy this game immediately, but it really is dumb. || Zarala2010 - Looking at this sweet verticality and stealth mechanics, I'm tempted to try a one-man assassin playthrough. With bows and daggers and killing a lot of drunk goblins in their sleep for some easy XP :D || J. P. - I can’t believe how awesome this looks. || Robert Mersch - This is going to be the best adventure game ever created || Brandon Adams - This looks absolutely fantastic! || R.Jensen - 40:25 :Skyrim flashback || Scott Chase - The oddly-big hands creep me out || DanXelite - Swen and Larian. This looks incredible. So happy how upfront and honest you are, even going as far to point out bugs that you're working on fixing. I will be playing the absolute hells out of this in early access and beyond. I really love the effort you put in for every little detail. Thank you all at Larian for being so wonderful. || B Eveson - I would love it if the player choices were also voiced. || Greg Davidson - I played this game on a PlayStation and PlayStation 2, now I am no gamer. I have a life and I got work to do, but if this is anything like the original, I would take time out to play it. Greatest game and story line ever! In any game. || Dave - This looks incredible!! || LuvLexyU - I mainly hope they make animations more natural. 
Jumping being a skill like it is feels so clunky when you see it like that. || Qua - I’m quite liking the UI changes a lot of people were complaining that it looked too much like Divinity 3 || The Narwhal King - Holy shit it is DnD Xcom and I think I love that. || Master Chief - Amazing job. I hope to someday work for a boss half as good as you! || sedriensmorgasbord - Swen: ""If I can discover that way shrine I can bring my other people here.""
Swen: discovers way shrine
Also Swen: leaves the rest of his party standing idle while Swen perishes || Valdo Monteiro - Looking good! Please make an option to make the dice rolling faster. This screen changing and animated dice roll will get so tedious after the first few hours... if we could do it on screen or with  popup window, with  faster animation, would be appreciated. :) || tain2002 - In my opinion they need to tone down the magical effects on actions like Dash and Jump, just have the character limber up or check his shoes, || John Fenton - Minx.  Go for the eyes boo! || Skaven Misinformation Agent - This looks like a great way for beginners to learn d&d. I didn't realize it played like d&d. || Dominic Manester - I really hope I get to embrace my inner mindflayer on my quest to become an overmind and restore the mindflayers to their former glory. || jimmy wahl - is there a ""Select all button"" out side combat ? :) || Pesky Bee - Holy shit this beggining animation is awesome || Marko Petkov - Larian has done such an amazing job of translating the 5E gameplay.  As someone who isn't a fan of 5E this looks AWESOME!  Can't wait to play it. || minto smith - 11:35 that the voice actor from the Witcher 3 || Brutaux - I just want to say that this cinematic introduction is one of the best I've seen across any platform, but I feel the music scoring is having a bit of trouble holding up the imagery.  I would love to hear much more intuitive sound design and intensity in the final production. || Sukesa - really enjoying character details, shadows, light simulation, voices,  fast animations etc .. || Alex W. - Yep, there’s a Wilhelm scream || Total War Destroyer - What's up with the first guy's voice? Keep popping like it's cuts. || Kel'Thuzad - No modifiers to dice rolls? Or are they just hidden and added automatically to the total?
This feels more like Dragon Age with D&D rules than Baldur's Gate || houseofcore - I've played two campaigns... haven't even completed.... them and I am so confused || TheCutWolf - ""early access""... oh no... doesn't sound good. :( || Terry McQuarrie - As the decades passed, and time took it's toll, I always dreamed it would come to be. Fearful always that it was just that. A faint, lost, dream flying out of reach on gossamer wings. Never to return home again. But the dream had changed over time. It is becoming clearer. I can hear the call of dragons in my sleeping mind now. Though grey streaks my hair, and my weary bones ache from harsh decades lost in distant lands, I keep placing one foot before the other. Over and over. The visions of my sleeping mind fueling the fire within my waking heart. || 10,000 Subscribers With 0 Videos Challenge - Me at 1:23: Well, so much for eating right now. :/ || Loz Adorni - Would love if they fully committed to that 3rd person perspective option for world exploration with an even more behind the should view and wasd movement, dragon age origins style || Kaleb Bello - Damn Lae'zel lookin fine af || The Nomad - So this is turn based? Gd, welcome to divinity gate 3, shadows of sin || Soupkitchen - The game is already looking amazing, cant wait for it, but make sure y'all take your time making it! || Michal Folberger - Anyone noticed the flaming fist in the backround? :D || Draugre - My only problem with divinity original sin 2 was that everything was so bright, i prefer a darker asstetic... But this looks incredible in both graphics (which i don't personally care about graphics) and gameplay || Michał Michał - Divinity Gate 3 looks great:) || MLKdasBedRock - in knowing the teachings of Zerthimon i have become stronger || Matheus Filipe Costa - The game looks amazing, I wish the streaming it didn't mess the quality.
I can't contain myself with excitement over this game. || Sahara Antarctica - Gale's voice sounds like a character from  The Secret World.  I wonder if it's the same person. || Raguru Bru - Those gnomes and Goblins look great! pretty surprised by the female Goblin tbh. || Leo Nielson - Gith, partnering with red dragons to stop a Mind Flayer? || Venatio - Damn, they managed to do the impossible and make a Githyanki CUTE! Wouldn't mind Lae'zel dragging me off to her hometown of Tu'narath for some ""long-term indentured servitude."" 
<>
Also, the Goblins are much more relatable and coherent than prior depictions in the Forgotten Realm lore. Not only do they speak ""Common"" (aka the Localized Market's Language) very well but they are also willing to converse with Adventurer's before fighting. || polyquaternium7 - The Underdark looks amazing! at truly different and very dangerous world compared to surface realm. I wish we could've seen more of the myconid village || Donald Haney - SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY❤️ || Rinamtelin - I can't wait to play this. || Josh Noble - I feel ashamed, I completely forgot about this || Transcendence Studios - Just picked up original sin 1+2 after seeing how great yall are doing on this one. || Duchess Van Hoof - Regarding the change in dialogue, thank you! It really distracted me from the actual dialogue and what was going on.

Otherwise, I hear you have a good reputation and what I see of the character customization and gameplay looks excellent. || Cynistrelle Cadrelle - OMFG!! I want it!! I know nothing about d&d but i hope there is romance. Like dragon age did 😭😍 || Spicy Nova - Dude I love dnd but I have no buds to play with :( || Lin Pan - That's the cutest goblin I've ever seen || Nightbot - just 3 more levels and i am almost a level 30 wizard in real life || Josh Phillips - it looks like outside of combat no restrictions on spell use? i was wondering how they would not make it super punishing || Michael James - Only 15 minutes in but this looks sick! I love what you guys are doing! || Jamal James - This might be the game that brings me back to PC.  Oregon Trail was the last game I played on PC back in 6th grade 1987. || Bamda Seven - This game is going to fight with Cyberpunk 2077 for my free time. || Sensei the Inked - I wonder how long is it gonna take me to get off the player creater screen this time? || Nick Brook - Baldur's gate 2 was one of the greatest games of all time. Will definitely be getting this too! || Andrew - This mocap and voice acting is on a whole damn different level || Dr. Luv - I would like a little dice tray for the rolls instead of that little animation || AMFX9 - Can’t wait to play this, it will be my first Baldurs Gate. Looks like a really great RPG. 👍 || Death Sandwich - Great call on the initiative order change. 
...Well I mean, it was kinda foolish to have thought the previous one any good; the idea should have never seen the light of day in the first place, but I'm glad Larian came to their senses.  || Blood God - I hope my rx 580 sapphire is doin it's job right :D || Lemon force - Looks great I hope they voice the dialog choices || Raul Torres - No funny sarcastic dialogs? I'm not happy with that :( || Ben Raga - I wonder if the strategy of casting Healing Word on downed allies instead of using higher level spells still applies in this game. || Agata Sen - I love this guy :D || The Indie Diary - Considering I think their last game is the best RPG ever made. I am pretty excited. || Shawn - If you need me I'll be licking windows until this releases.. || Erik Malkavian - I had intended to watch this... Wrong date.. || Gaven - Can you make it so you decide if you wanna dsh after the end of the first movement like in actual tabletop? || Cory Merritt - is that goblin, Johnny? witcher 3's Johnny? || EROS M - TIL The Underdark is just some dudes basement. || Matthew Bjorkman - I know I am probably just viewing this with nostalgia goggles but I prefer the isometric view of the older games. || John Hansen - Please make it possible to die from dysentery, for the Lulz || SilverLuck - Are they going to add in voices for the characters? || sparkynm156 - Baldurs Gate has sure evolved exponentially since my days playing this on my Apple ][e...
  Where is Ultima ]I[ , Wizardry, Zork, and of course my first game introducing me to the Digital run of D&D... Beneath Apple Manor... || Naga Sadow - With that kind of camera angle i sincerely hope you're able to use WASD controls. It'd be annoying to have to click and drag the character and camera everywhere. || Tooka Booka - Omg it’s the mind flayer || spamfilter32 - One question @larianstudios: have you put any thought into gamers that get motion sickness from the perspective this game is using? have you implemented or researched methods to reduce perspective related motion sickness? || Esprit Vagabond - Thank god you're using the metric system || Swirvin' Birds - Looks great but honestly I am not a fan of the goblin design. Way too human looking. || Table 1SG - Ahhhh that was Amazing!! || Akeche - So I guess there's no option for using abilities with different skills, huh? Strength for intimidation, for one example but just about anything is supposed to work. || chaoswraith - that Thunderwave was awesome

14:04 || CybreSmee - Looks amazing. || Jabba Da Slut - Was it the stream or did he have motion blur turned on? Because every time the camera moved it blurred/went lower resolution. That said, game looks and plays great. || ForPain - That devil didn't even let you stay and finish your meal. Rude! || Lispy Queer - This game looking hype af || andrewryn - this looks like DVOS3 || monsterboy50 - It's great that the game is developing it's own theme, although I feel like the spell channeling animations are kind of over the top. It feels like you're readying a Kamehameha when you're casting a simple cantrip.
But that's really just up to personal choice to be honest, the game has definitely vastly approved since the last showing. || hirrful - Divinity 3 look great... || Eberhard Latte Macciato - i didnt pay for the first divinity and downloaded it back then from a torrent site. i wasnt able at that time, but i buyed all dos games on release, when i finally had the money to. i want you thank so much for your work. good job guys. || tyson atkins - What BG 3? I never heard of it || francesco fortini - WOW Divinity 3 original syn!! ahahahahhahahahahha  turns system: your turn:SBAM, monsters turn: SBAM...and so on! During enemy turn i have a cofee! such a boring and stressful... || TheBod76 - 46:12 :D || Aaron - Early build or not, this is a gorgeous game. || nico castro - Never played the previous ones but this one gives me Dragon Age Origin vibes and I love it || jamyle garmon - I like that all the DC checks are on the table so you know what you need to beat. || S. - Why is he playing one person at a time, instead of whole team? || Vertigo1055 - 51:40 I've been PC gaming for over 30 years and any adaptation from the D&D rulebooks to video games has had some minor tweaks. But, with the right story, environment settings, and adjustments it can seem very seemless. From what I have seen in this live stream gameplay I feel like any changes made will not interfere with the overall feeling of that tabletop experience. I'm sure there were people watching this with their rulebooks out looking at every little action taken and flipping pages like a mad mage as well as screaming at their screen about how something trivial did not match up 100% with Pg. (insert number) of their rulebooks. Honestly, I find it hilarious the scope of anal retentiveness that can be found in the world. So far from what I have seen of the gameplay this looks like it's going to be one of the most intuitive worlds built from the D&D branch of games. And after playing Divinity Original Sin 2 I am absolutely glad it was Larian Studios that got picked for this project as I feel they were the best qualified with their talented team. Yes, not everyone may have been familiar with the D&D system but there's enough there I am sure that it made for a smooth transition from Divinity to D&D. Here is my thanks from the very fibres of my heart and soul to the Team at Larian Studios with their amazing CEO that has given us a glimps at what is capable when you put imagination and technology into one tighly knit package. Thank You! Cheers! and stay healthy and stay sane! || dimleaffall - Weird robotic physics!  Fun to see this thing in development.  Cannot wait for the game. || Jason Andrews - Hope theres a feautre where you can see all the rolls on screen || Yoru Kage - They made the mindflayers SO COOL || Igor de Oliveira - As a future paladin, that devil part will be quite interesting || Juodas Varnas - God, i love the goblins in this game.

Will they be playable? God, i really hope so. || Aether Veilborne - I hope illusion spells make the cut in this game.  Though I'm afraid that such an open ended spell school won't make the cut...

Hopefully the game comes out on the PS5 in the future. || Blueblaze5 - This looks like a buy from me, so far. I want to know, does it have co-op? Me and a friend had an absolute blast playing all the way through Divinity: OS 2 together, and it would be a dream come true if we could do the same with this game! || Samuli Sironen - So they listened to people complaining about the initiative system, that is amazing || Leland C - This looks great! It's unfortunate that this audio is constantly popping, it makes this so hard to watch. || bacchusacolyte - Make a remake of dark sun next! || Thomas Soroczynski - Hi !!thx Larian for this <3 but  please  I really hope that you don't force us to play pre-built characters like in divinity 2 that our own characters can be consistent with the universe
 and have their own storyline ! (and a nice vf voice) x) || A T - This guy is productive in what he can do in 5 minutes! || tontoldoos - The last scene reminds me of the last of us 2 || baludlad - I'm way too hyped for this!!! || MrEpick - I can't believe how AMAZING the environments looks! || jeffrey peters - no one I mean no is going to mention how he looks like dude from witcher || Squirrel E - RIP Dark Alliance || Ali Ince - ...wait... I can't custom make a character? :( I want to see my charisma mod, I want to see my expertise :( || Agrona - OMG I just found my next RPG!!! Would be cool if the main character would be voiced as well :) But dang this game looks amazing!!! <3 || James Lewis - I don't know who the devil guy was modeled on but he seems very much like Grand Moff Tarkin from Star Wars to me. || richard rodriguez - Wow this looks so good. This is exclusive to pc? || OllieG Hamster - Game looks great but watching you play was painful. || Schoko_Popcorn - I have never played any D&D game, but this looks so damn good!! Can I play it as a total newbie to the franchise? || Reav - Spells look amazing || nyk7979 - Githyanki on dragons vs Illithid in spelljammers.  nightmare vs nightmare.  Love it! || Sacha D - WOW looks amazing || ringwraithdestroyer - Its disappointing they didnt keep the more real time combat style of the first 2 games, traditional turn based just feels less fun and is a drag :/ || flooxy_doox_XD• - Wow... I found this from an ad... the ad was just this entire thing. The full 1 hour and 30 minutes. || juggernaught79 - This game will make a lot of people get kicked from their MMO guilds lol!  Can’t wait for this!!!! || The Cyber Satyr - Besides cyberpunk 2077, this is the first game I've been truly hyped for in a long ass time. There are destructible environments, right? And it is story-driven, ie, lots of dialogue and dialogue choices? Done by the same people who made amazing games before?
... || CafeSpy - have you been hanging out with  wil wheaton  by any chance? if so it might explain your frequent bad roles. || tyler Mcleod - Wait is this Baldurs Gate 3 as in Dark Alliance?!? That was my favorite game growing up holy shit! || MuppetLord1 - I do get a feeling mindflayers dont get enough hugs when growing up, with them going around putting slugs in ppls eyes. :´´( || Awkward Snow - Hype dude you guys do great work || Twizer911 - Jesus, expected a text game with updated textures, got Divinity 2 mixed with Witcher 3... absolutely amazing looking... || Tony Frohock - I don't know what it is but I absolutely love that the main character doesn't talk. I think by hearing you read what you have chosen to say in your own mind, you almost don't need to hear it again, it's distracting. It's really good this way. || Kain the Dragon - I think it looks great so far, but the lack of sticking to D&D rules concerns me:  those to-hit percentages were crazy high... Like rolling a 2 or 3 on a d20.  I get it makes combat faster but it's less an honest expectation on what you'd get out of pen and paper. Also looks like spells aren't spell slots per day... Meaning things that classes get that allowed them to recoup spell slots are off the table for power calculations (I.e. warlocks, wizards, etc.) || Akasha Bhairava - wow. I'm sold. || Waltz Leafington - Cant wait to play this beautiful game || Swift Bow - That cinematic was tight!  Blizzard quality. || devinreed21 - I NEED this game!!!! || Shadow Wolf - first lesson of the game, dont split the party || Tom The Turtle - Gonna listen to this on my commute || Brian M - Larian is a blessing in this age of battle royales and esports. || SkakLordOfDaHunt - Can I travel alone? I kinda want to become an illithid. || Niccolo - How different will gameplay be from DnD 5e? The wizard was able to misty step and thunderwave on the same turn. || B Eveson - I hope the camp background looks like the surroundings they camp in. Showing a swamp when camping in a basement does not contribute well to immersion || The Noble Rot - What an awesome cinematic trailer though || Ernie Miller - Please time this with a second covid tax give away so i can buy a PC that is capable of running it. || Giant Dad - Oh, MY GOD, BALDERS GATE THREE BAYBAYYYY, WOOOOO || Richard Henderson - It’s a small thing, but a little animation of the group clearing up camp would go along way. To see everyone fall asleep on bedrolls near a fire is cool, but then having everyone just getting up of the ground is kind of funny. || Greg Jones - Man, Divinity Original Sin 3 sure is shaping up well. || sparkynm156 - At 27 minutes , the dead headless sheep's belly is kinda undulating... Is there anything to that m || Shard - The goblin camp is his pirates of the pancreas || Kevin Johnson - I wonder how they'll handle spell slots. || Nickrak - Well I can already see two playthroughs in this just by deciding to embrace the tadpole or not and thats just by seeing two hours of gameplay || High Marshal Helbrecht - Do you have to take those party members or can you make your own? || Ugurcan Basoglu - I'm very hyped right now || Verdigris - I would love if there were key commands to link/unlink party members. Unlinking and relinking for positioning in DoS 2 is something I rarely did, even if it would be beneficial just because it was easier to just move forward with the party. || Shurik - I wonder if its gonna bee mod friendly Cant wait to see what people will create once its out || William Torres - The music for Raphael the Devil feel like Gunter O Dim. Wouldn't that be a crossover for the ages? XD || Konfused Kam - One month till i get my hands on it || Tomáš Bartoš - im so going to buy this. || Nain pasmalin - Continue like that. WHERE IS MINSC AND BOOH????????? || crackerblk - Baldur's Gate 3 and Bloodlines 2!!!!! Both looking incredible. An old man's wet dream. || Antonio - ""And Uuuuuuuuuuuh."" ""Ehhhhhhhhhhh"" (I'm teasing) Can't wait for this game! || David Wetmore - Never split the party. || nofebak tryagain - Sound is broken, but there are other videos of this live stream, better to search another one || Toveri Juri - Dash mechanic should be streamlined so that it's automatic when you select a distance that's far enough to require it. The way it's done in Xcom and few other TB games, it's just more convenient. Of course there should be an indicator that shows the difference between dash and regular. Hopeful this things will be ironed out in the EA || BlazingRefrain - Hope there's spell slots, skills and proficiency's. I also hope that the rule prohibiting two 1st level or higher spells in one turn gets into the game, or else casters will be even more powerful in this game. || WoodPileDenmark - I just clicked but can someone tell me when this game is set to release??? || Daniel Witten - I really hope this comes out on ps5 || namekman01 - anyone know what the playable races are? i'd love to do an aasimar or drow character || WE_NEGAN_NOW - Spew my green tea all over myself when watch this. || Memeboss - I have a weird question, will all movement be mouse based, or will we have to option to move with ASWD keys like in dragon age? || TattooMikeVsGaming - Anyone one else rooting for team MF? Poor dude is lonely lost his dungeon crew! || BL4ckH3LL - 7:00 gameplay start || Kwasi Media - Wish they'd stopped showing cinematics because no matter how great the game looks, it never looks like the composited footage of an cinematic. || kolosmenus - I feel like these goblins are too articulate and not ugly enough xd || Sahara Antarctica - Nice to see decent looking characters. || Mehmet Emin Şen - mage voice really sounds like karliah from skyrim
i cant be the only one right? || Fool Phobic - OH CHIT...!!! It's real...I played the original back in the day over and over.  Even my wife did, and she (so she claimed) hated games. || Mr. Pandabites - That cinematic is absolutely incredible. When the mindflayer plucked a biological control to teleport, I was like ""Yes, give me a tadpole,"" I want to be you. || Качур, який бачив деяке лайно - анімації трохи дригаються, деякі занадто різкі, але в цілому гра склала чудове враження. ЧЕКАЮ З НЕТЕРПІННЯМ! || Johnny Tindel - can't wait to play. || illumin81 - 720p guy is crystal clear but the game is still 360p..GREAT! i think I'll wait if I'm gonna spoil the game it better look good || juggernaught79 - I wish I could voice act for a game like this.  I bet it’s too fun! || Gorbz - It is nice to see an Illithid starship again. || Richard A - I love the look of this game. As a big Baldur's Gate fan, I always wished I could see the world this detailed and up close.  I'm really glad you guys fixed the dialog system as the whole past tense/third person whatever stuff was super weird and I was concerned it was going to annoy me enough to pull me out of the game. 
The verticality of the world is really amazing and makes for such dense and interesting locations for exploring and fighting. I still feel like the jump action should be toned down so as not to look like a super power, but that's a minor thing and I can see why the decision was made to make it look the way it does. Motion capture still needs some work as it's jerky and when the motion first starts it's often very abrupt. I'm sure that will be polished up before release.  || Dylan Perez-Rubio - I'm not a fan of how dash is implemented. It seems like you can't use it if you've already spent your movement. 

What would be better is an action that refills your movement bar. That way it would be more intuitive, and allow yourself to move twice your speed without having to commit to it at the start of your turn. || Johnny - I love this, but Swen really has the worst tactics xD || pacmanpakkas - I just wish the choices were voice acted || DEADMAN ONCAMPUS - Question why did it take so long for this to come out because the end of baldurs gate 2 on xbox there was this guy in a tomb saying  he is bringing war ? || viperkilla123 - Why do a lot of the models have overly large hands || JustOneNpc - I actually really liked the narrator from Divinity Original sin 2. I hope they release a patch or implement him as an option by games release. || Mr Noodle - are they gonna be adding more classes than shown during character creation video 3 months back || That Red Rabbit - Since this game was announced I always wondered if you could play a bard, might be too difficult to do buuuut I at least need to know, it's killing me ( also I don't think Swen ever used that extra dice roll and it makes me laugh everytime I think about it) || Blair Sinclair - is there gonna be Multiplayer like in D2? || Bombless Dodongo - I’m kinda bugged how your modifiers don’t go into things like persuasion rolls. That has the potential to make big decisions pure RNG, which is NOT good in a video game.
That’s my only big gripe though. This looks like a really good D&D 5e adaptation so far its glorious || Sharif Jackson - Does anyone know what this is coming out on? || Tokam Nich - if this is going to be D&D like, i hope they add some modifiers to these D20 rolls. rolling 14+ is going to be very inconsistent without them. || Vwlss Nvwls - Looks great.  Had to stop watching after the Devil part, because I am afraid of spoilers.  That I saw coming though. :) || Thorn Delwyn - Those faces are pretty deep in the uncanny valley for me. || A Guy - No matter how hard I try I cant get used to this looking exactly like divinity  2 with clean graphics. || Derek Blue - If they end up including a DM mode similar to that of Divinity Original Sin 2 but expanded to work with 5e then this might just be the last game I ever buy || Kristen Argyle - I'm annoyed. Like, no one needs eyeball worms, man. || Jester 88 - This seems like it’ll be fun || Šimon Valeš - Swen ""Why did I do that? That was really stupid"" Vincke || James - Those goblins sound like the Godlings from The Witcher 3 and I love it. || Mike - why wont Swen heal his MC though ? || Максим Томи - Howard Phillips ""H. P."" Lovecraft? || sanddry - I’ve been trying to finish playing Divinity Original Sin 2 and it’s gotten me even more hyped for this game. From the looks of things it’s turning out well so far! || RPS Corp - 5 points with a 2h sword..man...you must have rolled a 1 on damage, or its not built right. || Andrew Vincent - Shouldn't Gale be saying ""Go to the hells"" since there is more than one hell in the Forgotten realms? Regardless, this looks really really good. I'm going to get a new laptop for this game. I'm very much looking forward to it. The last real D&D rpg in this vein was Neverwinter Nights 2 and I've really longed for a real D&D rpg for a long time. The only thing I'm not happy about is that the combat is turned based. I'm a fan of real time with pause. Turn based is just way too slow. How many 10 plus minute battles can you have before you start to realize things are dragging.... Either way, I'm going to give it a chance. I may end up loving it, who knows. || ands1983 - The action activation is going to get very tiring:
Click-Whoosh-Bam-Click to use
It should just be a single graphic effect so you click-whoosh-click to use.
Less is more. || Swany - Is this guy the voice of one of the bosses from the first games? || Gaven - Tadpole cheats everywhere... || Field Marshal Fry - y'all seem to like splitting the party an unhealthy amount... || J C - I was counting down the days until this demo came out, it didn’t disappoint! || Brad Smith - Hey chat! I recently bought Baldurs gate 1 and 2 and Divinity original Sin 2! Which do you recommend I play? (first). || TheBayzent - It's been a while since I played Spelljammer, but didn't Nautiloids need Helms like all Spelljammers?

How are dragons an abstract for a Wizard?🤔 More over after the Tyranny of Dragons thingy. And the Dracorages. The Gith is a weird thing, but Red Dragons should not surprise them. || Hurtsmith - Looks promising so far. I don't really like the result of a perception roll being immediately knowable to the player however; not sure why you'd want to broadcast to the player that there's something there but they just missed it. || sedriensmorgasbord - For the first 30 mins, I KNEW there had to be something off with the audio. The depth of his voice just seemed so unnatural, I didn't recall it being so deep in the last livestream. I thought I was going crazy or something. Thanks for fixing it! || SteelCoffin - Goodbye real life || G_Odu Of the North - ooo, this looks fun. I didn't know it would be turn based and would have all the little cute touches like the dnd dice and the narration. That's great for me, I tried pillars cuz I thought it would be like this but I'm way too mentally slow to do rts combat. It's got all these neat little touches, like the perception thing. This is cute as hell, I'll play it. || Erik Brandt - The character animation is fantastic. || Erisson Magalhaes - I need people to play divinity 2 with me on ps4 anybody down || TheDustMan 03 - ahaha gimme the undead player option please || Dirge Novak - Can you choose your companions' classes like in DOS2? || O.G.Moose - What is this, Divinity??? || Rui Pedro - Sweet f*ckin' Jesus!! This game just seems to get better and better from an already exponentially high mark! || Matteo Polloni - min 15: in ded 5ed core rules you can't use a 1° level spell (guiding bolt) + another spell in a bonus action (healing word); if I remember correctly if you use a spell as bonus action, you can only use a cantrip ^^ || Anna K - Insanely good. Larian could make 10 games with this type of graphics and story and it would sell like hot cakes! Amazing job, the best party-based rpgs of 2000s are made by Larian. || Savage Dragon - Hope they'll update the UI and stop using old icons from Divinity. || Kaitensatsuma - Illithid Space Ships.
What a power move by Larian. || Chris - small suggestion: tone down the blood effects. the pools created in the fight around the 14 minute mark were a little distractingly excessive and maybe a bit too BRIGHT red. gave me Tarantino vibes. hahaha || King Jaffa - Why is this a lot easier to look at than dos2? I love dos2 but I could never figure out why my eyes seemed to hurt after a while (never happened with any other game) || PointingOutObvious - Good D&D game to feed my D&D craving during this coronavirus pandemic. || CM - 24:02 It might not seem like much but I think realism could be enhanced by making the insides of mouths darker and less clean looking. Right now every time they open their mouths it looks like they have a set of plastic teeth || stephen mudie - Hope you can move as a group and not have to go it alone as this dude seems to keep doing. || Marek Zegarek - Teeth look a bit creepy, goblins hands are rather large like it is in WoW and they have a wierd symptoms of twitching. || Tormentor - hahaha I LOVE THIS. 688 diskliked the turn based game :P  WOOHOO FOR TURN BASED GAME!! || Navhkrin - I feel like the devil is strongly inspired from gaunter o dimm, even their sound tracks seem familiar, but hell, i like it. || lendial - god this game has no right to look so damn good for a turn based dnd, better than even dragon age inquisition graphics || Sideways Obama - So who’s here from smite? Titan forge other game i guess. Cthulhu. || Split Klickety - Looks Amazing || Tam Hawkins - I was wondering about the goblins seeming rather inteligent and elloquent so I looked up the goblin stats in D&D and it seems they have an inteligence of 10 there which is the average for humans if I'm not terribly wrong. Kinda surprising normaly Goblins are shown as clever when it comes to trapping, tricking and backstabbing but not so much everything else. || Michael Pitts - By the time this game is released I will have a completed gaming room in my house. I'm gearing up for this game. Got a NAPA leather Titan from secret labs and a really nice L-desk on the way. I would love some Larian/Baldur's gate 3 decorations for the room! Anyone got any links to some cool stuff? || Rocket Rooster Films - I hope there is a chapter where we could play as a full blown mindflayer. That would be an epic finale. || Pokenopoly - 1:00:59  Wait, what?!  Volothamp is in BG 1 as well and this takes place around 100 years after ;) || Wyatt Williams - What kind of specs on PC would it take to run this game? || K Wars - Goblin Slayer would like to know your location || Aboc Stark - I’m curious... are you going to have subclasses in the game? Like Hexblade for example? || Alexx Borst - I may have missed it, but using the tadpole does what? || Phelipe Auer - THE TANK IS A SKINNY GIRL??? REALLY??!!! || Leonardo Matias - Very polite and well groomed goblins. Things have truly changed since the AD&D days. || Caio Belém - Does new equipment change the character model? || Mike Mac - This game looks perfect. The only complaint I have is there's too much blood. You can use blood more effectively to bring out an emotional effect. If you behead a person. That amount of blood is good. But just stabbing a person shouldn't have that much blood. Blood should be used much more dramatically in games. Otherwise, I can't wait for this. Wizards couldn't have made a more perfect choice than Larian. || Slakk292 - Will the MainCharacter  be voiced in the final product? || Encalagon - Is modding going to be supported on the game so we can homebrew stuff into it?? || Alternative Rock Type Beat - I played bauldurs gate, dark alliance on ps2. Imma check this out || B Eveson - not a big fan of the arcade effects when selecting actions. The rest of the game looks fantastic though || Zippitty22 - ""You have worms in your brain, and in 7 days, you will turn into a Mindflayer. So you are trying to find a healer or a Cleric to help you."" 

A few moments later.  || replaygeorge - Looks great and all. On the other hand the characters feel so weak, I am not sure if I want to play again this type of game where you are constantly underpowered (I played a lot of these in the past). || lvloneratata - looks like they stole christmas lmao || Stefan H - ok, i m hyped || Illionus - What kind of multiplayer is this? I like rpgs and turn based and I’m looking for a game lol. I play wow but I want a more tight nit coop play. || Rayrex - next person who wants to mockingly says that this is ""just D:OS3 / isnt baldurs gate"" needs to be reminded of the documented fact that:
WIZARDS OF THE COAST

CONTACTED  || DLY - Blizzard should watch this and learn how D4 should be handled. The real Diablo players like all small details, not bombs and fireworks everywhere. || Marco Luciani - Ok, all is great and interesting. BUT WHERE'S MY DRAGONBORN BOY???? || Nightmare Blade - God I love Larian Studios. I just started playing Divinity Original Sin 2 again and I love the attention to detail the devs have put into the game. It's amazing how much content they've added for free even after release of the game, something that many other ""AAA"" games won't do. I definitely hope Baldurs Gate 3 is just as good as DOS 2!!! || tontoldoos - Dnd on computer. Sold! || Rafael Masoni - This is beyond amazing. My criticism would fall only on not having modifiers applied to the rolls (work in progress, maybe?) and the over the top effects for mundane things like jumping, Dash, shove etc. — these aren't spells, the effects should be dialled way down or even removed so it feels more like the simple physical tasks they are. I also don't like that elves look just like humans with pointy ears — bring that more alien look from previous editions with bigger angled eyes and big colored pupils! || Mike Grant - looks pretty gimmick heavy || The Battle Moon - Will this have online coop? || goodgirl runthis - Aww man i thought it was gojng to be like the baldur gates games that was on the ps2 back in the day but it like the one on the pc...😢 is they gonna make a remake of those without the turn based stuff? || Zeus_ TheGod - I wish divinity original sin had this type of camera view. But its no matter, it was still fun too lol this looks great, can't wait to play it! || Twincast - I wanna adopt that goblin kid. XD Pretty please? || xray538 - When is this out? || xtlx - this game looks goooood || J Barry - like most of you I cant wait, but I also dont want to watch, I want to buy this and be totally surprised by it.   No spoilers. || EW Elmo - Anyone see the similarity to Temple of Elemental Evil? Perhaps it's the turn based system and the system of where you can go in a round. || Mazzy - I cannot wait for this ahhhh! Divinity Orginal Sin 2 was so fun can’t wait to play with 5e mechanics. I have nothing but faith in Larion Studios great games great people! || Coop Shanks - Ah man I was hoping for gameplay closer the the Xbox version of the game || Master Yoji - Can EA just hand over the Dragon Age series to Larian || LaconicMarksman - 13:24 ff 
So this game doesn't have the rule where you can only cast a cantrip (as in, not a levelled Spell like Thunderwave) after using a bonus action levelled Spell (like Misty Step)? Wew, Sorcercers are gonna quicken double Fireballs, a LOT, nice. || TimeIsUpYourParolesBegun YouKnowWhatDatMeans - Indivisible was lackluster. 
Borderlands 3 was a heartbreak. 
The Last of Us pt 2 is a disappointment.
You're our only hope Larian... || Johnathan Denson - Is this only going to be on PC? 
also ....
""Deep gnome"" you mean THE svirfneblin? || Bryce Kuchenmeister - I don't like how the characters don't speak when your choosing the lines.  It's one thing when it's your main guy but we know the other characters have voices so why not have them say they're lines? Not everyone is satisfied saying the words out loud themselves. Other then that looks great! || Rob McD - Dude, you need to get new dice || Shannon Percy - I'm very intrigued. I've only played Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance and I love that game. I do see that this one and the first two are radically different from Dark Alliance. This looks like it could be fun || Bjarne Gerhardt-Pedersen - I hope we will not have a ticking monster timer constantly rushing us, like the avatar project timer in XCOM. || Nick Strife - Two spells on the same turn? 0_o

Misty Step + Thunderwave should be illegal... || namekman01 - hei, just an idea. but could we have the option to have a bar of background-chat-text, instead of floating dialogue. or a chat log that shows what they said. i dont like missing lines of dialogue if i can help it || Kleek Vishon - I love gameplay showcases like this. Not really scripted, a bug here and there, just raw early gameplay || companyoflosers - is it just me or are there some audio issues going on here? || J CHENG - Very nice so far, I am buying it!!! It would be nice if a voice reads whatever option I selected in each interaction || Michael Courtemanche - TAKE MY MONEY! || J CHENG - Very nice so far, I am buying it!!! It would be nice if a voice reads whatever option I selected in each interaction || Iluminacho - i really really really want this to have some degree of multiplayer || Lívius Vank - Raphael the Tiefling of House of Hope... My sort of charracter... || calipdis2 - Looks great! || gutspillage - Omg, his elf character is so hot! I want to see romance between him and Gale. || dirtyzombiedude - Bring this to the ps5 or x dont leave us behind. || Lattekahvi - i just hope that there will be critical role cast in VA department || WowDude1029 - It would be sweet to get dark alliance 1-2 ports for switch || LanceReactor - For an alpha.. this game looks fabulous. || MordenGaming - I'm so happy you guys at Larian are making BG3. Great job overall so far guys. Keep it up! :D || GaldirEonai - I wonder if that Spectator turns out to be a familiar one...:P || GoreJar Horizon - What races we get? || Cmac 613 - The kids kicking the corpse is hilarious || WorkOutGameOut - Sees Githyanki
Takes deep breath in Illithid || Chris Brown - Maybe actually use a more Baldur's Gate UI using the sides of the screen? || Danklin - This gameplay doesn't inspire me to buy full price. || Bull Paxton - wanted to watch the vid but the audio clicks were too annoy :( || Paquet Albert-Gabriel - i wish i could try this build to see what is possible in it. || BrushWakker - Is this gonna be on ps4 || Joe Burgos - This looks AMAZING!! || Mowsef Mow - if you rest in the underdark does it shoot you back to your surface camp?  if so that's terribly disappointing and immersion-breaking || Benjamin Lakes - There is an honesty about Larian Studios (and Swen!) that is so refreshing compared to the staged, money grabbing you see from a lot of gaming studios. You guys rock! || Jason Andrews - So if ur party members are right beside each other in initiative order you can deciede who goes first. Pretty great feature || brad potts - baldur's gate: abortion quest || Adras Adraki - I wish the other party member barged in during convos to offer their pov (agreement/objection or even maybe try and dig information).

They are supposed be actual characters, so standing idle doing nothing feels weird imo. || Nath The potato - Is it only turn based sin combat? || Алексей Баландин - bg 3 +mod 6 man party like DOS & DOS2  :) || Jeff Shanks - cant wait had to stop so i can play unaltered || iNASA Media - Its crazy that the actual lead developer plays the game exactly like  me!!! lol || 48some - Dragon Age Inquisition is that you ..? || Quilnux - Does anyone know what D&D edition the game will be based on? (I assume it's a modified ruleset like the first 2 games were.) || hakeador4000 - Imma make a goblin only party and none of y'all can stop me || The Muslimah Mommy - LOVE IT BUT SCARY  || JohnR300 - I hope I can play as tabax/vampire, Dragonborn, lizard folk, and warforged.
As for classes I would love to play as a blood hunter, necromancer, sorcerer, and ranger
This is of course assuming they add these to the game. It will be sad if they don't, but I will understand || Gentleman Madness - I still have balder's gate 1&2 for ps2 || MrO9 - The mind slayer!!! || 12halo3 - I hope dark vision is lightly obscured because they only see dim light for 60ft || 2slob4u - Game doesn't seem to have much of a baldurs gate feel not gonna lie, but still looks amazing. || mar mar - Do we know if we can use different members of the party inside dialogue? Or does the leader (or the first in line) always has to talk? Imagine if a dialogue starts and the only person who can answer is a low intelligence/charisma character because they were in front, whilst a much more suitable party member is right next to them and staying silent. || Szymon D. - Will there be an another BG live ? || Helmuth Gerka - Day one purchase for sure. I think this is even better and more interesting than DOS || EZ1cks - I think I prefer the previous type of dialogue options, at least for the main character. Not because they were presented in the past tense, but because they were less defined. The same way the absence of voice acting for the main character leaves his voice up to your imagination, so you always imagine the best voice and delivery for that line (and that better fits your character) -- much like when you read a book --, the options of response written as vague descriptions, like in the previous version, let the minutia of the dialog written for the player's main character, or the characterization in the dialog options, up to the player to fill in the gaps and imagine it in the best way possible. I thought it was a very original approach. Most of the times, I feel frustrated with the defined dialogue response options in rpgs, especially the ones with char creation, as they are hardly written in a way that expresses my characters the way I want them to or think they would sound like. If you need to make all the responses fit the way of every possible character that could be imagined by a player, I feel that writing the dialog options in the form of narration and letting the player be original in his head with the actual speech is a more elegant solution than writing generic dialogue options or risking getting in the way of role playing by being too specific with the responses and end up characterizing the character for the player. || Bryan Melhuish - Can we seduce this devil guy? I want him as a romance option, plz. || clipCommander - I've never played this series but I love divinity. Is baldurs gate more difficult? || Mathew Lanier - So excited to play this game :) my only complaint is a personal preference but I wish that when wizards have staff in their hand that the magic would be pulled from it or that it had more of an RPG element to it other than smacking/shooting bolts out of it.  But even still :) this is amazing!! Great job || Mentatskillz - I know it's a lot more work, but I hope that they decide to add voice work and animations for when the party characters talk.  It's jarring to see the silent protagonist in this game that does such a good job with everyone else.  I feel like I need that extra something to help bring my characters to life. || Donald Haney - This is EPIC || Thomas Donovan - These spells effects look really lame....what a shame. || leopoldo basilio - Hoy yong AMO nyo meron na namang no kaso SA general Santos city fiscal swindling, active pa!! Hintayin nyo. || lorenzo501 - started great, but then it became disgusting with the eye stuff... srsly, was that really necessary <.< the dragons though, that was lovely so I forgive u || Unknown Pleasure - I thought baldur was the god of light in northern mythology || Zubset Thomas Muus-falck - How do i get alpha acsess?? || The Poisoned Staff - Is there an ""18+"" setting? Swearing? It would be more immersive if NPC's swore instead of saying ""Backside"" || Deccease Yang - i really wish baldur's gate could remain 2e or even 3e... || sykune - Thats one hell of a misty step || D Main - Great voice acting. Is that Nikolaj Coster Waldau? || Gracen Blackwelder - I don't usually like rts-style games but this is so loyal to dnd I'm 100% gonna pick it up on release! The combat looks exactly how I imagine it does at the table || Dr Shepherd - You doing good! Only thing left is real time combat with pause function. Thats all we BG fans want. || APrilisRus RUS - That githyanki looks prettier then any of me3 human female characters || D Betz - So my question is are you stuck with the same main character or can you design your own. || Joe Szabo - Can all my family play co-op ?? There is 5 of us. || Planetar - Would love if they add few little things:
1) Right click on monsters to see some description & stats (and to journal tag bestiary)
2) Little hidden loot that show up after lucky perception test (like in original BG)
3) Fight and throws log? || Xellius13 - Both this and new Bloodlines...was worth waiting 20 years 😍 || Mark Bennett - I own BG 1 & 2...can't wait for 3.  Let me know if you want a beta player...I will pay for early access. || aemun83 - Did he guiding bolt and healing word on the same turn? || J I Joe - Octopuses are quite intelligent even more than some people)) || Jairo Quinino - I really hope there are more companions to pick from I don't like vampires and I have a grudge with those githyanki || baritonetennisman007 - They made the right choice choosing Larian. They are a fantastic studio. They deserve all the support. || Sybelius - Ok. I'm in. || Jacques Jtheripper - Is this gonna be on current gen ps4 or ps5..looks pretty detailed, much more than their previous games. || PsychoTech - omg. this is like a better Dragon Age Origins.. YEASSS || Anatol aka Delramian Tobler - looks cool that game but the presentator isent a looter realy. Well for that runn it is better to hurry so he can show us alot more than just picking up all that comes across our way. :-) || LEONARD! - Jesus this game looks so good im arguing with the screen. Start at 29:30
 for best story experience of this || Jar Jar Binks - Will there be voices for characters you control?  or will they all be ""the silent protagonist""? || Brad Lee - this game looks sooo awesome, but i dont like the combat, i suck at turn based combat :D || Julius Sidon - Actually... why does everything always have to teleport in your games... i hated that in divinity 2 already. It makes it impossible to tactically plan, as seen in your presentation. || Manos - I nominate Larian as the next industry sweetheart || Mike Stracke - It would be cool if the dialogue selections were voiced, especially if you're playing one of the pre-made characters. || ellescer - Come home, gamer. || nelson junior - i want to play bard :T || Sein Schatten - Baldur's Gate 3 - Attack of the brain parasites || Aragorn Galt - I wonder what kind of job they'll do. I liked original sin 2... || Malprava - wheres the real time combat? this is not baldurs gate for me without it to be fair || Stayreddi da god Abraham’s seed - Is this on ps4? || TheRealLitenith - Pre Alpha gameplay already this tantalizing🤤, If this game gets mod support, for new dungeons, Campaigns etc, it will bring new meaning to DnD night for years to come, pretty exciting prospect i think. || Sidney Ferreira - I genuinely hate turn based games, but when I tried Divinity OS2, Larian made such an amazing game with an interesting world, story and characters and actually a really engaging gameplay I fell in love with it. 

Baldur’s Gate looks amazing, can’t wait to make my elf warrior 😄 || Ian Melzer - 0:08 ""You should've acted...They're already here...The Elder Scrolls told of their return...Their defeat was merely a delay...For the time after Oblivion opened...When the sons of Skyrim would spill their own blood...But no one wanted to believe...Believe they'd even existed...And when the truth finally dawned...It dawns in FIRE...But there's one they fear...In their tongue he is Dovahkiin....DRAGON BORN!"" || Splendid Truth - long slow game. hope this will have controller support like the ones they made before.
Didn't like the dice rolling system.
Game looks good but it looks too similar to divinity. I don't like that. || q3Phoenix - Pffff.... Dragon Age !??!?!?!?!?! Im crying....( || Agni Das - The game actually looks pretty. We have had the tech for years... but no one applied it. This is what those xboxone and ps4 games should have looked like instead of brown canyons and deserts with a sun glare everywhere.
I hope they don't ruin the look when they polish the game ... || Xander77 - Jesus, what's wrong with your microphone \ sound editing? Everything single sentence sounds vaguely cut-off. It's deeply disconcerting, and very hard to listen to. || Sir_ Ladykiller1 - Liked before it even started. || Arte Final - Portuguese subtitles when you start. Please. We love D&D in Brazil. Pleassssseeeee. || Alex Voznesenski - Very cool devil :D || Keepy - I was hoping that the entity you meet at camp was actually the tadpole coming to meet you.  When it ended up being a devil creature, I felt disappointed, having the whole devil within come to make itself known and make the fight for your sanity seem real felt like a fresh angle; but this is a bit of a cliche and it's too bad.  What a wasted opportunity! || Pseudo Soul - Wait, what is this? Is there anything like this currently out there? || seltin1988 - i hope this game has an good turtorial as i have never played any d&d games, not to mention that i hope for an kind dificulty rating... still it locks good and a must bye! || Lars de Koning - While CD Project Red delays their game again this guy is just having fun streaming his game that'll be done when it's done. || Mitchellaneous - Give me Underdark or give me death || ElRamon86 - Capture resolution 480p?😔 || Ray Cornett - Hope they add another way to do combat like instead of action points you just roll for what ever action your trynna do like in real d&d that would be cool || Harkness78 - Kind of weird how much talking to goblins there is. I just played all of BG1 and you don't ever talk to a goblin, like 2x you talked to kobolds but they are dumb as rocks. BG2 I have talked to ogres and trolls (trolls are exceedingly stupid) but still have yet to talk to a goblin. || Luiz Marques - i am a big fan of bg. I don't know ... I don't want to be rude. what I want is to congratulate this team for their work. but when I look at this game, it is inevitable to think: this is not bg. it can be a great game, but this is not bg. pillars of eternity * is almost * Baldur's Gate. the characters lacked a little more charisma and depth and then it would be bg. however, I hope that bg3 will be a success. || Rat King - Here's hoping dlc/updates add some favorite races, a kenku in this game would have entertaining dialogue || STILL LOADING JAKE - I cannot wait for this. || Wiggy McDoll - how can they dash AND attack in the same turn?!? || Cadowyn - There will be Bards. Right? || Dimitar Delev - goblin faces are waay too humanized... where are the larger bulby noses from the art in the books ? || AyarARJ - I love the die roll checks that are done AND transparenty & attractively presented! Look, I haven't played D&D in like 35 years (does watching Mann Shorts count?) but I'm so looking forward to this BG3 and also Solasta. So glad it's not in some little text-log panel in the bottom right...no no, right up front integrated into the game. Nice! || Niki Tiraj - One minute is 8 rounds here. || Lee Fon - Is it just me or does 7:20 look like Andy Samberg? || Martin Vigo - 10 minutes to kill 3 easy enemies??
No thx.
With Bioware/Black Isle this was not happening.
When this game comes out, I will play my own BG 3. BG 1+2. || Bryan Rickens - I feel like one of the only ones who liked the previous dialogue system :/ It truly felt like I was telling a DM my response at the table. || Alexandre - Wonderful RPGs turned based!  Portuguese language  support? || Bruno Zuicker - TRANSLATE PT BR PLEASE!!! || william lyell - Ok, how can an Illithid themed game not include the Psionicist or Psion as a player class? Just saying. || El Gringo Feo - Next game is warhammer XD || nmNioki - Just gotta Love Sven || Flavio Lepri - Some constructive critique: prone condition need some animation. Like the character going prone instead of just popping into it, it's a bit wonky. || A Guy - Underdark looks like candyland || Scott Adams - Does Volo have a goblin wife?? Lol || Gaven - Would be ncie if you couldnt take a full rest every 10 seconds... || MaliciousGrim05 - Lmao at the Baldur's Gate elitists freaking the hell out that this is turn based instead of the wonky real-time & pause system. This is one of the few titles I'm excited for this year || shield of faith - Is there romance between the characters ? Like good ol' baldurs gate 2? || 606hunter1 - These baldurs gate 3 showcases have been fantastic || CJay - Baldur's Divinity and The Gate of Sin. || deboozombie23 - Not a trailer, but real gameplay, the times they are a changin' || albert einstein - In the dark age of the Last of us 2. This is the game I need. Thank you. || Termit Społeczny - Tabaxi? pls :3 || Rey - God I hope this is good.. the original is what made me a fantasy nerd lmao || Kishor Sandilya - Can you use WASD keys to Move in this game or do you need to use the mouse? || Daniel Murphy - Really minor thing, but that action bar is SO much easier to navigate and manage than the one in DOS2 || NeckiousBeardous - Two spells a turn? Not RAW. If you cast a spell that has a casting time of one bonus action (Healing word, misty step etc) you can ONLY cast a cantrip that has a casting time of 1 action.  (13:30-13:45) || Arthur D - U can cast two spells unlike to pen and paper? || chris o - Is this supposed to be a continuation of dark alliance 2 or is this more like the original baldurs games || Mat Nov - I will buy this if our decisions really matter✌️😎 || Dharma Chameleon - This isn't coming to consoles is it? || Dakie Salamander - Something between Neverwinter Nights, Dragon Age 1 and Divinity clone... Not BG anymore. || Netreo - A possibility to play as a Drow? || Zap Wholesale - Not an ounce of originality here. No thanks. It does make me want to watch Wrath of Khan , GOT and Avatar again though. I don’t support blatant IP theft. || Haste - If this is anything like dos2 I’m dead for a month || Caleb Eiben - Hope this gets a ps5 release.... || Yamcha Dragonball - Veteran baldurs gate player here. Sounds are ""wrong"", it needs the chittering of spiders etc. as part of the ambient. Also the attack/cast animations are not very ""Baldurs Gate"", please bring back the spell sounds with the latin chanting. || Jesse Brown - I was a bit bummed at it being announced as turn based, but the more I see it, the more I'm into it. I do wish it was a six person party though. Also, Shadowheart's hair is interesting. lol || Ricky Moore-Daniels - ...Yes.....i can Hear it within the Cortex of the Invert, Lemon....i cannot deliver him from the clutches of the Underdark. #Mind || Chad Luciano - I was  so young when Baldur's Gate  begun...now I am younger when Baldur's Gate 3 starts...like a kid again. Awesome!! || Grinnar - Choosing to go with Larian Studios means that I will not be getting this game. || Gabriel Hage - Camera is really bad! || ageDC - Creo que físicamente ya no puedo babear más... 🤤😍 || S. T. - I hated having fire paddles everywhere in the original sin and unfortunately I see the same here || Orosian5 - I wonder what the trade off is for using the 'tadpole'? || Chronicles of Bap - Looks brilliant || incarta - It looks EXACTLY like Divinity 2. That street at the 10 minute mark, if you were to zoom out into the Divinity isometric perspective, you couldn't tell a damn difference. Ok nevermind, it's even more noticable in combat, looks like they cobbled some old assets together and called it Baldurs Gate 3. || Victor Mota - Did they change Shadowheart's nose? || Arthur Morgan - Very unfortunate they switched to turn based gameplay for a dungeon crawler type game. I loved the older baulders gate games || thebingthing - This game better come out for ps4/5 || gxbmb - whats the release date? || 12345bomber - baldurs gate needs to be dark and serious, this just looks a 100% like divinity. It does not catch the flair of the old games at all, it may be a great rpg but this is NOT baldurs gate. Why this bright colors, the look is way too colorful. || Daniel Raymond - Ah man I hope the Tabaxi are a playable race. In our current campaign I’m playing a swashbuckler tabaxi, he’s a absolute blast to play || Cyan101 - Only complaint is the video/stream quality is pretty awful, other than that cant wait and hope EA manages to stick to august || SaintedSirr - The intro movie is fantastic... Why can't we get a full movie like this? D&D deserves a good movie. Make Elminster making of a Mage. || Muscle Man - My opinion will not be popular, but Its not an authentic ADnD, and this is not Baldur's Gate 3. Its just ""Advanced"" Divinity 3 with different name, trying to parasitize on the name of legendary series. I do not mean that Divinity was a bad game, its wonderful game and i love it, but it's different and not a DnD one. For example, when you 1st time open a Pathfinder: Kingmaker you like ""oh, this look like Icewind Dale 3, nice, true Dungeons and Dragons""  || Notorious Schwartz - Is this new divinity 2 mod?? || Faculdade da Vida - Looks exact same as divinity.
And looks a lot like dragon age inquisition. What dont look like is baldurs gate game :( || Brandon Heat - I don't get the dice system, he rolled a die but didn't add any modifiers... Am I missing something ? || smonkey001 - divinity original sin 2 reskin || Rising Legends Podcast - Yeah gonna have to get this i think || Tony Sylvester - Jesus, D&D has kicked it up a notch || Hollow Hound - this is going to be so fun can not wait || HumanTiCK - Am I the only one getting DA:I vibes?  Like this is far more polished version of DAI style? || Ian L - Pretty cool. The jump animation is crude and too ""heavy"" feeling. The rest of the movement was pretty slick and made the jump feel really out of place. Seemed like she slammed into the ground harder than she jumped, like it was placing the emphasis in the wrong direction || c4urselfboy - Robe of vecna + amulet of power 🤣🤣 || Christian Ayers - Malady is a narrator!  I never noticed that || MrAnimefreak153 - did they speed this up? because it just sounds and looks a bit off. || Kobthehawk - Dragonborn? -_- || Moonthurst Projects - Am I the only one who still wonders why the 3 D&D movies were so crappy (at least I think there were only 3) but when it comes to game cinematic they are killing it.!!
Now to be fair, the movies were done ages ago and the CG tech (or in this case VFX) was not what it is today. But I'm not entirely talking about the visual aspect of the movies. I'm also talking about the story and the acting in those movies. If an entire movie was made from what we can see in the BG3 cinematic not only would I be glad to pay to see it on the big screen but that's the kind of Blue Ray I like to have in my collection. || Christina A.H. the predator - How do you suppose we change not that I need any answers it will do it itself || ThanksIfYourReadIt - Please give us an option to get trough ALL the game with locked top down camera, and not a watch this we made a movie with bits and parts where you have to do busy work until you can see the rest of the movie.
Also if you have highground and cliff sides and what not, that's cool. But if every character have effortless traverse around them then its not a feature, its a GIMICK! || sedriensmorgasbord - Can you romance your party members!? Gale is a fine man. Fine, fine man. Need lovey-dovey relationship interactions. Must romance. || Christina A.H. the predator - Neal come over here || Chad Snowball - Console? || Dray Belle - Wilhelm Scream 3:00 || Smells-Like-Ass - Does this game feature vancian magic or is it more along the lines of divinity’s cooldown system? I cant tell from the video || Jeremiah Sells - Should not have been able to misty step and thunderwave in the same turn. || kanthPL - A thing I didn't like in Divinity: OS and that is creeping into BG3 is over the top theatrical dialogue. Whimsical and/or funny dialogue has its place in cRPGs, but
when it's too common it starts to become really tiring. You can see what I'm talking about during the conversation with Raphael in the video. I was constantly wishing he would get to the point. In vain. The other thing that's killing my suspension of disbelief are overblown special effects and overexposed (i.e.too damn bright) daytime graphics. || beany poopy - yo where the hell should i begin if i want to get into the the world of dnd || Zionswasd - They should take off the over-the-top sfx for the jumping, it's just jumping, not some superpower, it looks doofy. || Amrothel - Coop with friends in PC???? || Jhoana Salcedo - 1 get a new one for me to do it again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and I don't want to go to the gym and then I will be there for you to be a king to me and my mom and dad are you doing awake at this hour of sleep and I || mimi chan - Can we control the difficulty of the roll?  because I'm not really a fan of these mechanism. || undeadcrunk - Take my money 💰 || Eric Singbiel - As a dude in his 30's who bought BG1 at launch and loved it, I feel it's my right to express my displeasure with this game (in its current format) and why.  I appreciate the old BG battle format with real time turns/rounds that required you to pause every few seconds to issue new tactics in order to get through a tough battle... this game is completely turn based and the battles seem very boring and way less challenging...  granted it's still early in development but the battles seem way too small.  I would expect higher difficulties to be nothing more than ""oh I got bad RNG, let's redo the battle 5 more times until I get the right RNG to beat it!""  That doesn't add complexity to the game, just monotony.  I don't think every character having multiple extra abilities like ""action surge"" makes up for the lack of strategy in the battles... it arguably makes it even less challenging.  I'm disappointed that they just took an old engine they had laying around and added new graphics, models, and story to make it BG 3. || Szass Tam - Please for the ***** sake stop! making physical attacks and abilities, feats etc look like a hello kitty, my little pony glitter fest ! || Muros - This game is going to be so much harder than Divinity OS 2. That alone already heavily separates it from the series, all you naysayers! || Kyle Ganse - Wow so amazing || Rob L - Has Larian said whether or not this game will have a DM mode (like DOS2 had)? || bluedragonranger671 - this look fun || Nester r - Divinity III ! || Malachite Demonic - Please make Raphael a romance option!!!! || ari wiguna - good movie make a movie 2 hour /episode will good hehehe || Bubonic Duck - Just learned of this. Is this a continuation of the BG story, (and will we be able to import our BGII characters)? || Arthur D - Hmm shame there is no voice in dialogues || Michael Mendez - Uhh this doesn’t look like Baldurs Gate what is this? || Knavenformed - They SERIOUSLY need to tone down the difficulty.
I got all the Divinity series games after playing DOS2 with a friend of mine and I noticed a lot of them suffer from accessibility due to difficulty, especially Dragon Commander. || Robert - I smashed the like button and commented for the YouTube algorithm, but I am not going to watch the video and spoil my pending experience. || TacDyne - So for the past two days, you guys and BG3 have been one of the top three discussions I've seen in the ESO zone chat! Lot of people hyped! :) || The Last - I wish more video game companies do a presentation like this when you over sell the game People over expectations || Brittany Marking - this game has totally captured me! I love it! || shield of faith - Any dungeons and dragons books for recommendation? I have the D&D fever coursing through me, and it must needs be satisfied by the immersion only a good book can provide. || Paweł Sobolewski - i am SO happy the dialogue choices were changed from the narrator-type to actual dialogue <3 || Robert Hill - I'm liking it. But I really do hope they is more work to be done on voice talent. Specifically, non-human races. Even a slight filter would push it light-years ahead. Lilt up Elven voices a bit, perhaps. Lower Dwarven voices an octave or so. Goblins sounds exactly like humans with a scratchy throat at the moment. If you want immersion, make non-human voices distinct in tone from humans. You should have at least a fairly good idea of what kind of being you're talking to if you close your eyes. || Felipe Pérez - It looks so beautiful, and the dialogue is reminiscent of the Witcher. This is gonna be great. || Lawrence Barfield - Isn't going to the Underdark before level 10 a bit early? || christian scott - Im beyond happy that this game is happening and its Larian making it!
I want to give some feedback :) Now this is just my opinions and I am just one dude...
first of all my impressions are this. The graphics are great and the combat system looks hands down amazing 10/10. Off course its pre early access, so things like demon wings and combat blood look funny and so on. No problem. I have no doubt this will look amazing once its done. || Adrian Koch - They gotta take a look at their characters hand proportions, some are really out of whack || 123Dunebuggy - Shut up and take my money! || Rastasplash - Game of the century candidate right here. || # IRL - just an idea since Dale is a popular name in AD&D maybe the wizards name should be Dale rather then Gale ? Cannot wait for its release :)) || BFKC - Baldur's Gate: Imagine Dragon Age, if Dragon Age wasn't clearly just a ""nice try""... (Even if it was the ""best try"" many ever played, aside from the somewhat different The Witcher 3.) This is true by definition, since Baldur's Gate is sort of what they had ""tried"" in a new IP, with some freedom of mechanics (didn't even work out). || DreamWarrior - it looks great, here are some nic-picks:
1) I don't care for all the flash when you do an action such as jumping
2)tone down the spell casting effects, just have it centered around their hands
3)how are they able to fall down that hole to the Underdark and live? ropes should be used || Thomas Whitley - Why doesn't this vid have closed captions? || Rudi - who tf cut the commentary? completely unnessesary || idcWHAT uthink - Ok... But wheres Jarlaxle? || J Weezy - Game looks tight || Andrew Vincent - Should  have voted for the hobgoblin  lol. It looked more interesting  than what we got lol || YUM - Who else thought it said bladar's gate? || Leonardo Cuiza Co. - Tremendo juegaso. Me duele no tener un pc para q al salir pueda jugarlo. :( || Pallav Bhardwaj - Why no voice lines for character || Tracey KJ Thomas - I get that this format is how actual DnD is suppose to be played but I’m so disappointed that they strayed away from the first 2. These were the only games my family and I could play together and that’s ruined. Waited 10+ years for this just to find out id have to wait even longer. Any suggestions for other games we can play Diablo might be too advanced for some ppl in my family they’re getting old lol || Wes Anderson - A mind flayer? Damn it,  hate those creatures in any game. Their status affects are annoying. || David Clifton - Is this in vr? Please (crosses fingers) || Chris Stark - I'm sold || ETERNAL WNTRZ - Yo its my boi cthulhu😂😂 jk || SgtSquare - What are we looking at in regard of voice acting? Every single line fully voiced, or just selected ones? In the camp, Lae'zel was fully voiced, but oddly silent when speaking with goblins? Intentional or just pre-alpha stuff? || Brodor Legate - Is this coming out in 2008? || Kathryn Free - That UI bar is kind of weird. I hope you make the UI adjustable. || Keith Williams - Is this supposed to be cthulu || Joe MacLeod-Iredale - 1:22 Khaaan!!!!! || rudess84 - Origin of sin 3... || Vincent- Pendragon - If I had a small criticism it's the fact that the party isn't as active they're just standing still not doing anything like npcs maybe have them do some minor movements or something life like would give them a better visual effect the wizard doing wizard things as he standing or the orc girl leaning into a wall or tree. || Humble Kodama - Who's the actor behind Raphael's voice? || Logan Ross - Wow.  Let Larian handle Star Wars next. || H1dden Somewhere - Wait is this a movie? || RequiemReforged - is there no ability modifier in this game? nothign had ""+2"" or anything to it. did they not let that happen? || Djefley Florentino - Very good, but still with no identity. It's look like  ""Divinity 3"" || Joseph McLane - Too realistic, you build relationships and make one bad dice roll now they hate you. || Urban Wolf - Is this turn based? || Dillon Cain - This was oddly kind of like giving your mechanic uncle bill keys to ferrari. He's read all about it, he knows how to shift, but all he does is drive over curbs and peel out. Sure, he gets you to the 7-11 and there are some fun moments, way better than if one of their engineers drove you there, but oi, maybe just a touch less mumbling about how this should or shouldn't do that and what's here and hmubbmbm, and ok we'll just mmrhmmbm. || Thurmanation2011s - Orcs are racist now guys according to the DnD company. Kind of makes you wonder why they view minorities   as savage Orcs. || Bacon Press - Ok.  Might be good. || 3H3E3 - Hype || Omega Red - Wow || Jesse Fitzsimmons - Not sure why they’re saying consoles couldn’t handle this || Andrzejjr. Drugi - This got me more hyped than the announcment of ps5 || MrSackbert - Pleaso no waypoint shrines like in DOS2 || Yont EvenKnow - He isn't a bad guy, just has an unconventional hiring process. || Vepris Thorn - why are the goblins British? || Mike Wright - 1:20:16 DIDI DU DU DI DII DUUUU || Eugene - Why so sunny all time? Where is cloud weather? || Victor Lawless - Hold on there a minute. I'm noticing a fatal flaw in this game during dialogue exchanges. You can't hear the reply coming from the player character and those lips aren't moving. You have lips moving and voices talking  partially in cutscenes but not in exchanges with NPC's. That is really messed up and gamers will notice it every time it happens. It's extremely irritating. It's a corner that's been cut, which forces me to ask...how many more corners have been cut and will be cut? Probably too many, that's my assessment. I also notice you have that everybody is on fire thing going on just like in Divinity 2....hmm....don't like it, never liked it, it's stupid as hell, fire damage should be timed, you get hit with fire animation, there's a burst of flames, you take your damage, maybe on fire for a few seconds and then it goes out and smoke rises from the character like a candle that's been blown out. Unless you're covered in oil of course. Different circumstance, different more aggressive animation and effects is warranted and expected. Dude is in flames and acting like it's a normal thing....lol...whattya mean I'm on fire? || A Rogue Panda - we need the ea like yesterday || metrux321 - The UI seems a bit convoluted, and I understand that it needs such wide array of options, but how about having some simpler options that branch into others? For example, you have a button/square for movement, and right clicking into it you get to choose the type of movement you'll use. Or a prepared spells button/square, that similarly when choosen will allow you to choose will spell to use. This should clean the UI a bit, without diminishing the options that you can use. It's just a small thing and suggestion. || Ivan Shulika - No ""Original Sin 3"" comments? Looks kinda unrealistic tbh. || Александр Мельников - о, дивинити ориджинал син 3 подогнали || J H - Divinity 3 || Mike Brown - man that devil is on top of his game. found the desperate sucker real quick, already know i'm gonna do one play through taking that deal || dtipp59 - Turn based major dislike!!! Ruined the original thanks for nothing! || Emiliano Zapata - Larian, you are like the second Studio Red in the world of gaming companys. 
Your storytelling, worldbuilding and love for you Projects gave me great joy and I'm sure BG III won't be an exception. 
I would love it to see you make also other genres from time to time, or perhaps another kind of RPG?  || Reyson Fox - Could not come up with a better studio than Larian to do the new Baulder's Gate III. So hyped will buy already! Still play Divinity Original Sin 2 to this day. || Nkari - First impression: the head movements when they speak feel soo off.. to jerky.. || sparkynm156 - I wonder what Eloquent Catch Phrases will be engrained into our Minds...  
   Shtay awhyyall und Llliisthund.. 
Sean Connery Voicing.. 
or || laughing fairy's - ive never played a baldurs gate game do i need to play the first ones or is the story not linked between the games || ruimar souza - Iria adorar, a Larian Studion's colocasse a opção de português-BR nele, somos muitos brasileiros, infelizmente muitos de nós não temos uma leitura de inglês tão boa, joguei o BG1 e BG2 com traduções feitas pelos próprios fãs, seria muito bom o jogo chegar no meu idioma, ficaria extremamente feliz! :) || Mario Peraza - Will not use it, will may it use it later... never uses it || JoshWMedia - so can you play this with multiple people? like they  play as the other party members? || spiritconsumer - I LOVE sven and larian studios || stormbard - Who is the VA for Lae’zel? || Shadowguy17 - So excited || Gregory Picone - I'm not sure if this was asked before but will the choices you made in BG 1&2 count?  Also, how many people in the party.  And if is a FAQ I'd be happy to read it LOL!! The game looks great I can't wait for it !!! || CND Marksmen - Any chance this will be on console at all? || LJScribe - There better be a good explaination as to why RED dragons were helping fight the mindflayer ship... || Vargoroth - Not going to lie, the fact that this game has voice acting kind of scares me. It means they'll either spend a lot of money on dialogue or they'll have to cut corners somewhere. I know both Bioware and BeamDog edited dialogue even after they had recorded the lines, but that's kind of difficult if you've already recorded every line. || Richard Lawler - was so hoping it was going to be just like the old Balder's gate games but this look so much better than i cold of hoped for || LostAdventurer - I like that they’re keeping any ties to the previous baldurs gate games  hidden from view for now but it’s driving me crazy wondering if any of our more long lived party members from baldurs gate 2 are gonna show up in some capacity. || NEVER HOLLOW - GOTY || TimeFluxGodKnuckles&Tails - Yuck why did they have to change baldor gate to a dame  strategy game  what was wrong with one and two  oh well || Christopher Romero - ooo hellzz yeaa...riding fire breathing badass dragons to destroy alien cthulu type enemies im in...im a huge gamer an know pretty much nothing of these games.only heard of it.. but ahhh never really played much pc games..unfortunately || Steven Martin - Real pause? || Ivo Renato - Why our characters ares dumb during dialogues??? || 8runie - I absolutely LOVE how real and transparent this is. Larian, please, never change.
Also, I cannot WAIT to immerse myself in this work of art <3 || Lord Samaels - ok, this looks like Divinity 3, but it is not a bad point, you make a great game and BG3 will be great, thank you || Klas Wullt - no this is wrong so wrong..3D.sacrilige!!!!!!!!!
At least its turnbased || Andreas Mouzakis - One problem, what's going on with the rolls are modifiers just ignored now, there are clearly skills and stats that modify them, so why don't they or do they just subtract the modifier from the DC... || RicoLen1 - This looks like Dragon Age: Origins meets Divinity Original Sin 2... fitting considering both were so heavily inspired by Baldur's Gate 1 and 2. I hope that unlike Divinity, this game has a good story from start to finish. I've yet to finish DOS2 because it's story bores me so much. BG1 and 2 were for well over a decade my favorite games of all time, until DA Origins was released, and then Mass Effect 2 on the heels of that. I love western RPGs, but if it doesn't have an engaging story and great character development I just can't stick with it. || DD - So many clicks just to make something happen...definitely not for everybody. BG3: The Click Edition. || Aikanar - Love the change in the initiative system for the classic D&D one, but theres still too much DOS stuff in the game. Would like to see less over the top effects on normal actions like jumping/low level spells and different colors (less bright) to not get that DOS mod feeling it currently has. || MasterFeiFongWong - I have fun Idea the ability to cast spell that throws out a chain or rope that will magically tie around enemies ankles and then the other end of it will tie to selected item, animal, or enemy in area. This could have some fun possibilities. Imagine you activate spell and then select the too targets for the chain/Rope to connect to in this case it targets enemy first then horse in area second. The chain/Rope magically flies out ties around the ankle of enemy and ties around horse then you just scar the horse with attach or something and when the horse panics and runs off, the enemy gets dragged screaming away. :D Or perhaps you target to enemies with it and it ties there ankles to each other interfering with there ability to move apart from each other and hindering there mobility, Please share this idea with game developers if you can. || josh - If this comes out for a console I will buy that console just for this game || Brian - Why are the hands so disproportionately large? || Максим Арефьев - Very intresting || Rob - I still feels more like a next Divinity game than a Baldurs Gate title... Not saying it won't be a fun game to play but I hope the look & feel still gets updated a lot before final release. || Pelordin - It looks lovely and no doubt it will be an amazing game! But those bright, glossy graphics of Divinity/DA3 style really throw me off... || kyle kinsey - There hands are big || Руслан Минхайдаров - The party literaly did wake up at the forest at start. This is bad. An end player no need to know how the party awaken and leaving their camp. Just start the day from standing at the forest is enough. Like ""Hey, they just leaved their camp. It in a corner of that bush"". || Jonathan Martinez - Please port this to Xbox One please please please 🙏 😘❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ || JOHNNY BRUNO .... - Please bring It to ps444444 || Mr. Berardine - Too bad it's more like Divinity and less like Baldur's Gate for my taste. || SpiritOfWanderlust - Shadowheart, Cleric of Shar:  ""If we want to survive, we have to trust each other.""



Shar's Clergy:

""There is a pervasive belief that her clergy aids those who have been wronged or who have suffered a great loss. Instead of offering release from the pangs of grief, though, Shar’s clerics reinforce supplicants’ regrets and feelings of betrayal, turning their focus to bitterness and revenge. Shar’s doctrine of vengeful nihilism appeals to those who have suffered great loss or betrayal."" || Vladimir - Non playable. || Revermen - Wow its Stargate || Eugen Bimbirekov - The view camera is not nice at all :( || Michael Mansourati - based and tadpoled || Snorlax - Goblins better be a playable race. || BigPupito - WHY IS THIS TURN BASED COMBAT?!??! Look, I understand there are pros and cons of turn based vs. real time with pause, but you have divinity for turn based already! Larian could have been the king of both systems, now I just see a lesser Baldur's Gate sequal :( (and no, it's not just nostalgia, I've played PoE, PF:KM, Tyranny, ...Real Time with pause still works great) || Натка Арканити - КАЙФ!! || Encalagon - Fingers crossed for a warforged showing up. || charley222 - NO HALF ORC ???????  no level 20  ???? || Marcus Hicks - Is it wrong to think that Lae'zel is really hot? Asking for a friend ;). || Erik Malkavian - 1:13:49 You can leave out the use of the word ""Stupidity"" Swen and I would be happier..sheez! || The Forms - The game is full of characters that make no sense for their role. More women warriors than men, from what I can see. A world like that fails to convince the subconscience. I know D&D is run by extreme leftists who are completely insane now, but this is bland and looks the same as everything else out now, and it's completely possed. Nothing like BG2. || Greentea Icecream - SO GOOOOOOOOOOD || Lion Tribe - I wonder if all this neo cultural/political crap is going to infest the games like it is the books... || Aaron Koop - 23:30 ugh, can you please not include lighted candles that have no explanation or reason as to why they were recently lighted || Erik Malkavian - 1:07:08 I knew that was going to happen when you were standing that close..lol || Phig Newt - The games may be completely unrelated but I really wished for another Dark Alliance-esque game. Even tho it was pretty bad in practice, Drizzt and Artemis weren’t as powerful as the main cast since you couldn’t change their gear, the story was meh, I had fun. I miss that sort of mindless dungeon crawler. || Dandy8bit - Divinity Original Sin 3 || Sean Casity - Just a question for recent events how is an orc considered a racist stereotype of African tribes? Last I checked Africans weren't big green dudes and gals with sharp teeth and monstrous behaviors, I can't believe DND creators bent over for that ridiculous group that loves censoring everything. || Tempting Fate - Why is the green skin's nose so tiny? || Lethal Dose - Oh Baby! Dark Alliance 2 is one of my all time favorite games this looks sick! || Tony Cárdenas - Why didn’t he cast feather fall on ALL his characters and just fell before the boss spider and that’s it? || Erik Malkavian - Have to say I really LOVE the Camera angles available.  MUCH more immersive than the original Baldur's Gate games. || mwells219 - What if I don’t want to play a female orc?  Do I get to create and choose the kind of character I want to play? || Average Centrist - i love how he's a bit shit at his own game haha, he's one of us guys || Anderson Eduardo Link - I just hope they improve the armor and weapon design... Is not that bad, but it needs variation, some way all npcs looks almost the same... And yes i know the game still in development!
Another thing is that i always have the feling that this looks more like a Divinity III that Baldursgate! || GodHimself - I really hope they tune down the RNG it's literally everywhere || Rastayeti666 - hmm gameplay and all is impressiv, but i rerally have problem with the visual ""feeling"". D&D was always for me something realistic or even grim, but the games looks dreamy, to pale a bit like a visualized fairatale, which was fine for divinity, but not for this one. I cant point out what the exact problem, to bright colours, to much or less saturated, not enough contrast, its maybe a combination of all. When you look at the visual tone of last of us and this one you can clearly recognize the difference and i would prefer the first for a D&D game. Still a safe buy, Larian proved already the make great games....and hell its a turn based D&D game, its been a while since temple of elemental evil || Andrew Rosengard - The goblins I see so far are exactly as I imagined: stupid, but not fools. The goblins believe themselves to be the top dogs, but when facing someone more intimidating then themselves, they run away like cowards. And goblins only care for themselves individually. || Mighty Cthulhu - 1 || Sean Crees - I love your game but wow are you bad at it. || Agni Das - There should be a manual check enter option for those of us who wanna roll a physical d20 while playing. RNG dice are ... terribly loaded at times, even worse than the imperfect physical dice. Plus that hands on feel ... that's what turns something into a cult classic. || Carl Star - I don't like their constant area effects and auto damage. At least a roll. Fire arrows now deal auto damage if you go through the area they hit? || 짬타이거 - DOS3 || lucu01 - dammit this would have been perfect for lockdown - ah well, self enforced it is, lol || Chris Montgomery - Cant support wizards of the coast anymore. The worst of capitalism is in the offices of WOTC. || Ivan Jovanovic - You are so unexperienced if you belive that turn based gameplay is more advanced than rtwpause where in background we have all throws and calculations without wasting so much time on unimportant encounters plus that is so unreal from true figt (rtwp) who waits turn while all kills one?!?. At least try to caves, dungeons and textures don't be generic and repetative so we can't call this Divinity dlc || Lock Skelington - You know its still not finished when you can cast two spells in one turn || Dan Uglw - cannot wait || Daniel Alexa - Very cool and epic || Alexander Arnaut - Typical Larian studio || Todd Stanley - I hate that’s it’s not like the old baldurs gate from ps2, loved the topside dungeon crawl of that game. || Olov Redmalm - This is looking so damn promising to an old BG 1 & 2 fan! 😍 || daebi37 - Disgusting opening. || Lucid - am i the only one who hates the animation, voice acting, and directing in the dialogue cutscenes? amatuerish at best, character faces are wax dolls - I don't think they are skilled enough to take on that yet, they need to stick to the above view dialogue interactions from DOS2 and don't get into this other aspect, it is awful - and the writing is cardboard cut-out boring and trite and typical fantasy jibberish - they got a long way to go and you can see in the dev's face he isn't happy where the game is currently - that spider cave is a mess || Your Nightmare - I prefer DIABLO IV than this crap || kangaxx - They are too british || Scotchtoberfest - Stop. Putting. Weapons. On. Peoples. Backs. It looks stupid. It looks and has always looked really stupid to have a 6ft pole stuck to someones back. || Braden Alexander - I was so looking forward to the traditional style of playing like the old boulders gate. This game will flop like crazy. Hate to see it. There not enough people that play d & d and they are trying to target a even smaller market. They should have just stayed with a regular rpg play style. Very disappointed. || Scupper - 49:44 goblin lives matter || AKraftyBasterd - + || Tom11 - Getrennt kämpfen - zusammen sterben. Warum verteilt er seine Charakter so dähmlich und kämpft so dumm? || 1988jockel - Let me share my thoughts in a structured manner:
Personal Opinion: I just love that Larian has been intrusted to creat BG3 - Larian Studios is awesome!
Hype State: SUPER HYPED!!!
Suggestion: Referring to the inventory menu, it would be awesome to be able to select multiple items (for passing them on to other characters etc.) This is literally the only thing I was missing in DOS2. || Jinx - Cthulu || samuricex - Really glad the combat is tactical/strategy.  All my favorite DnD games had this combat. || T T - The problem is, the maximum party size is 4, and the game focuses on lower-level gaming.  I like a) larger party sizes, and b) high-level gaming. || Svante Pålsson - Dosent have the bg feel to it. || 17joren - 14:20 the goblins don’t use Nimble Escape to disengage? Poor buggers.
I’m super excited for this, but I have couple other thoughts. The cleric missed guiding bolt but it still collided with the goblin, do you plan to incorporate animation of misses? Also taking some actions are so flashy lol dashing looks like some kind of spell. || pantagruel - Very cool DOS3: Dragon Ball Z edition! || Arvan KWSM - Liked the livestream and game, having to wait 30 seconds for chat to decide something every minute really killed the experience and made me want to turn it off though. || Ballin on a Budget Rhunter - Not the game I wanted, was expecting an experience similar to Assassin Creed || Dragonbeast6 - I love phase spiders || Kevyn Maddox - I'm a huge fan of previous BG games. If it's not hack and slash just doesn't feel right. Don't get me wrong, I like D&D but if it ain't broke don't fix it. || Michael Davis - turn game play? You lost my interest completely. I loved dark alliance and was really looking forward to this game. Won't be playing this, boo. || Mark Trow - #orcsarentppl || Ree e - Anyone gonna talk about how these dudes legitimately compared orcs to black people? || monmon mon - gud || swietoslaw - Yeah that What I was afraid, combat look just like divinity || Fabian Hoffmann - Just don’t rewrite drowse and Orcs thy are imaginary things they are not racistthere are black humans in d&d || yimliakum longkumer - Attack and spell casting animations need more work. Other than that, I am hyped. Please make magic and combat more detailed and interesting . 👍🏻 || TheBrainPain - I hope you can change the premade character's classes like you could in DOS.

A female fighter ruins the immersion. || Mad Jester - Why is no one talking about how this guy's voice sounds like a poor audio edit as if it was cut and pasted together by someone who never did audio editing before || Grapefruit Simmons - Was stoked until I saw it was bullshit turn-based combat. Ill just wait for the cutscenes to get uploaded. || Mitch Gaunt - So this is basically divinity with a different shirt on 🥱 || אופיר פוקימן - me: Hears that the game is coming out on August 22nd. 
me after a minute:  don't realize this is the exact date of my birthday. 
Me that While  I should go to bed another hour: surprised Pikachu face. || Ryan Neilan - Will the MC be voiced at all? Feels dead having so much voice acting but then your own character is a mute || Rebel Yell - Not a chance || Ivan Jovanovic - Turn based fight 3 days long what will be when we are 50 hours in repeating this?  Rtwpause please, you are now making real title not joke good at start but after 35 hours ... Forget abusing of 4m jumps and forcing loosing of focus with boxes and verticality we want real magic not telekinesis for noobs, no Divinity dlc we want Baldur's Gate the relic || Vulprex - I was actually hyped for this game but the turn based combat might actually just shit on that hype.. Not a fan of turn based combat || Blupp268 - cool presentation, because of the time pressure, everything feels super rushed though, pretty much kills any atmosphere. Next time it would be awesome to have more time at hand || Sparhawk122 - Way too similar to Divinity Original: Sin....  Even the tone seems similar. || Sonyetc - Hmm, dont ge me wrong, i love larian studios and everything they do (i enjoyed both Divinity Original Sins) but isn't this game looking too much like D:OS games? It's not necessarily bad, but i would still expect completely different experience. I see some visuals and sounds are completely reused... || Chris Beggs - Funny hearing all the voice actors from divinity 2 || Marcel - This feels and looks more like Destiny III, than it does Baldur's Gate III. || Viri Dai - lol, this is Divinity III, not Baldur's Gate || Red Knight - Looks good, but those jumping sounds have to go. Also, the interface needs a makeover, so it doesn't look like a Divinity mod. || Hugh Janus - Quite upset it won't be real-time with pause. I find it so much more immersive and invigorating than taking turns (*_*) || bad1080 - so you guys dont have a physics engine why? || Cryevil - Wtf why would the change the game to a rts after how great the first two were. What a disappointment this turned out to be. || Keko Hokko - When your day starts with Illithid and Illithid tadpoles ... serious flashbacks to Baldur's Gate 2, for me. I hope this will be good. || Isaac Fairchilds - The game looks great the man presenting it though has the charisma of a rock. || TalesOfBrian - ""You will see bugs"" Yeah like not releasing on consoles and offering cross play... Hopefully they fix this bug ASAP. || bennie de gooijer - Desire demonic art 

desire Demonic kunst

Demonic art

Demonic kunst || Porates - Has BG3 more freedom? DOS 2 was a mess regarding ""clear map"" -> ""map closed"" -> ""next map"" (never come back). And as well to limit auf enemies, no random encounter etc || James Boulger - It's funny how they are nowhere near Baldur's Gate in #2 yet the game still uses it as the title. || Gaven - characters look super stiff. Those wings in the devil looked super plastic halloween costume 1 dollar. || SenorPumpkinEscobar - Get someone better to host these streams, really difficult to watch. || Fun Punch - Awesome work! like everyone else, I can wait to play this game with all my friends! || Nirvel R - This is amazing, cant wait! Love Larian Studios! || L S - You can't imagine, how difficult it is to find the stream, I have tried to find it Yesterday, but I ended up thinking that it's postponed since there is nothing on Larian's channel:/ || Michael Hale - I love how over the top some spells are lol || Lolisama Overlord - missed the live stream. sad, where can i find the HD version? it looks so muddy even on 1440p. is it the stream? || Kahldris - I've been waiting for this game for so long and didnt thinking would happen! || Dawe - Love the new initiative system! Thank you! || HaTcHX - 30:22 Rafael reminds me of Lord Farquaad from Shrek. || World Eater - Barbarian only party titled ""Arkan's Fury"" coming right up from me on launch lol || SpookyFairy - I was into D&D when I was a child, then a big gap, now BG3 made me want to get into D&D all over again. || The Great Goblin Wizard Kazamaraz - I'm only 16 minutes in and they've shown the Attack of Opportunity reaction by that point. They've spoken about how reactions will be set and automatic in the past. The only problem I see with the reaction system is that there are plenty of times where you'd want to save your reaction. For example, you have 2 enemies near you, one runs away, but you don't want to use an attack of opportunity on that one, you know the other one is going to run away too, so you want to save it for the other. Same thing applies with spell reactions. Shield is only useful if you're actually going to get hit  || Jason Nash - I can’t wait :) great story telling btw || George Poptodorov - Can't wait to get my hands on this game! :) || Legion - I remember playing Dark Alliance on PS2 with my friend all the time and I really enjoyed Divinity OS 2 after a looong time not playing any rpgs.  I can't wait to dive into this. || Super Mole Retro - Wow, just wow!  I could just watch all cut scenes and be entertained! || Rich - This looks sooo awesome! Great graphics and gameplay! 😁 || Enclave Operative - Love it. Obviously reminds me of DOS2, but some DAO and Witcher 2 vibes in some places as well. Hope it isn't delayed! || Andreas O - And cleaning up the Mo-cap? I don't mind. There are not that great glitches. I would play this in its current state and still be happy like a child. The characters look beautifull, the game looks beautifull, the voice cast is beautifull. I'm content :) || Dontez - Omg this looks fantastic! 
You better be making a DM mode! We need it!! || Mick - yeah! Andrew Wincott (pretty sure thats the voice of Raphael i'm hearing) is awesome! love his work for black library audio! || avoidconfusion - Scary how much his character looks like him! || MothmanGaming - I like the look of the UI now as opposed to when we first saw it at PAX || Snesley Wipes - What are the odds my 2019 iMac will run this if Divinity 2 is okay? This is the first PC game in 10+ years that has legitimately got my thinking about getting a PC just to play it... || Юрий Девицкий - 44:50 - very funny moment) || Megatron Ryker - This looks amazing !!! I must play this now!!! || Connerie Velue - It is just me or i feel watching a dragon age inquisition animation ? || Fire Knight - My only regret was that I missed the book and Bahlders Gate 3 reveal on D&D live || oRion - This looks 100x better than the first gameplay vid where they showed of the beginning of the game. || Duchess Van Hoof - Must say, I do like the companions. Not quite BG2 quality, but very promising. || Connor Smith - This game's gonna be lit || Ralek Kelar - Don't you know, never split the party lol. Game is looking fun, can't wait. || Sean Morris - Could he not use inspiration on party interactions? That seemed interesting the failed persuasion of Shadowheart had no re-roll. || Cait Sith - How does spell slots work? Do you only get as many as in the dnd rules? I hope more else spellcaster will be pretty long rest intensive. || Meshga - Looks like its coming along great. || simpel - this guy is so funny xD || SCDJMU - The inventory looks so bad it makes me sad || Vicwaberub - Its like Ultima VIII: A Jump n' Run! :( || Rob Campion - I just want to be able to make a paladin in this game. || megatron184 - They've dicked up the action economy so much... || BlackLotus30 - so when he put on the boots... didn't change the model :S || Pierre - Oh please release the game early!! 
For once I'm happy with a buggy mess being stuck at home! || Aleksei Borsenko - Too bad that Sven's persuasion roll failed at players =) (we should've forced him to kill this goblin thou) || Bernard Mallon - This looks fantastic but am I the only one slowly being driven insane by the weird mic clipping?

Edit: they fix that around 37 minutes in. || Ben Ashby - I'm trying so hard to play baldurs gate 1 in anticipation, man the tutorial is killing me though. || Michael Parham - I am hoping this is the game where you no longer care for min maxing every single choice. Would like more info on opportunities for cathartic moments. ex: professions, in game politics/lore and such, allow us to eat the peach and smell some roses. || moonshineTheleocat - What was the first Livestream || Yi Lu - Cant wait to spent my money || esmackie Smackaroo - 5:20 skip intro || Dex Games - 44:48 Face plant lmao || MuppetLord1 - Hope it will be decent. :) || Blake Patterson - Anyone else feel like Swen accidentally lef the voice changer on? || Duchess Van Hoof - The dice rolls make little to no sense for me. How do I know the DC, the modifiers and so on?

Its not a very transparent system, can there be an option to change it? || Roland Kush M.D. - I ❤ Shadowheart. || Glen Bodino - Holy shit that intro is just epic || LXIV - The game looks good! || Gary Weeks - Will there be multi class options in the game? || DiamondDog001 - Wish coversation options had voice || theking ofinfinity - i wish the combat was more action with tactics like Dragon Age Origins instead of turn based but Im still buying this thanks to the 3rd person camera. || Mastery - Bro, 

Baldurs Gate, Cyberpunk.  || Cait Sith - Wizard 😍 || matthias staber - holy macaroni - HYPE || František Mihok - MY BODY IS READY || Timestamp Guy - is malady's VA the voice of the tadpole or just the general narrator? || Tiger - The future of the Baldur's Gate saga couldn't be in better hands. The level of possibilities, quality, and roleplaying is insane. This looks like to be a pure gem. A true successor to BG! Thank you Larian Studios! || Demonking J - Need this rn || Patrick Reitz - Do they have an official place to leave feedback? || mastergame1311 - Man, as a fan of the Original Sin games I am incredibly happy this game is looking as it is right now. I just hope some of the more annoying things from the OS series are to be addressed here (*OUT OF SIGHT* and characters unwilling to cross 2 centimeters-long  poison pools and such). || GnomeDeGuerre - Looks great, but shouldn't the gnome nose be bigger? || Steven Simmons - I kind of wish you couldn't understand some enemies and NPCs if you don't have the knowledge or spells to do so || SengirShowsU - Would love to have a change in jump animations for higher dex characters. Some ninja flips for example ^^ || Adrian Leong - Looks great, cant wait to play it.  Only thing I didnt like is that the player character and even the companion doesnt get a voice when using them to speak with NPCs.  Would be great if its done like the witcher or mass effect where the protagonist/character that's been used gets a voice.  Now he/shes just standing there blanked faced... || [-[tRiX]-] - Orc-yanki. || Bartłomiej Jastrzębski - Is that Witcher 3 music? || Soul Index - My only complaint here is that the player character never says the dialogue option you click. I understand that it's probably in an effort to have the player fill in the words in their mind, but I mean, for many others it's just odd. Having a toggle option to disable the player character's voice would benefit everyone || que sera sera - The constant screen shaking when using abilities is getting annoying rather fast ... and the normal skills like ""dashing"" etc are activiting like some kind of legendary skill (glowing etc.) i think it should be toned down. Other than that i like it. || UKRomka - Where is the preorder? || oldarus - one of the best gaming companies right now.  you are all amazing.  love these videos and play through with Swen Vincke.  

want you to know ill be buying this game twice! once on PC when its releases and again on console to play with my console friends if it gets released on console!!!  you guys are the best || Daniel Copsey - SSJAzraelShadowheartXx_Sephiroth_xX || Aprosule - Hey Dungeons & Dragons,
Next time don't give him a time limit.
He just wants to show off all the cool stuff they've made.
And I would have watched another two hours if it meant seeing both the Underdark AND the Goblin Camp. || Toby Barnwell - malady narrating? || Ekoba Naru - Why are the hands so big? || bopbop076 - Thanks Larian for this very promising RPG!! My feedback :
-7:20 What an handsome elven :3
-8:30 I know it's the trend with the 'Karen' style because of feminist, but please don't make all women companions feel and look pissed everytime. || Ann Grzonkowska - chad elf || Jan Rajss - Yay ! || bosstherapy - I'm confused if they're voiced acted, why not VA them when you're in control. || Kyle White - Gimme gimme || Goya Solidar - 19 dislikes from mindflayers || Chrystall Bawll - Anyone have any advice for a newbie? Am a huge fan of Dragon Age, Witcher etc and this game looks amazing, I'm just worried I won't enjoy the turn-based gameplay. || 1234kalmar - If this game will have kobolds or Tabaxi as a playable race , even if just as DLC, I'll buy this sooooo hard! || Ivan Dimitrov - I don't understand why people are so gung-ho about silent protagonists. When talking with the devil our character looks retarded, and the answers you could possibly give are completely inconsistent with his stunted behavior while the devil is monologuing. The story loses so much from the lack of vocal reactions from our character. I wish devs had the normal speech and then just gave it as an option to for the character to be voiceless, you can even get away with replacing the off hand comments you can make with a subtitles that the players click when they want the other party to continue. I'm sure it can be made to work. || Joel Pearson - It seems unusual for monsters to keep attacking downed characters when there are dangerous ones still around. || No Limits - A suggestion : There is to much blood around the deads. Also when they die to much blood comes from them .... || Tomthenightmare - We needed a Wilhelm scream || Min/Max Munchking - 16:00 when the Cleric casts Guiding Bolt with her action, she can't use a bonus action to cast Healing word on the same turn. Unless, of course, the game ignores the 5e bonus action spellcasting limitation.
Also, 3 successful death saves instantly puts you at 1HP? Hmmm, that makes things much much easier if you know what you're doing. || Skooma Gnark - what went wrong with the skill bar?! again with this tiny thing? a friend of mine was furious every second of playing OS1+2 with me playing mages, because he had to scroll through them like crazy to cast his stuff! the old bar in BG3 had 60, yes, 60 slots! you could arrange your stuff the way you wanted, and had them all out, so you dont forget stuff/have to scroll through like a moron! oh man... || Hash Pond - Turn based combat garbage. Did you latch on to the name Baldur's Gate to lure in fans? Because this is X-com with a generic fantasy skin. || Jesús Morales - After the game officially comes out he really should set up his twitch/youtube stream of the game. || M - It looks great, if I had any complaints it would be that it always seems like such a waste to voice act all of these minor dialogues when you could have spent the money it on creating more content... you could probably add entire chapter to the game or make quests that allow for more branching but instead we get to listen to 10 actors voices on 400 characters || James Brookes - Anybody wishing they'd voice all the lines when in dialogue?
Kinda brings me out of the game how the enemies dialogue is spoken yet our parties dialogue back isn't || Damien Spectre - Persuation Dice Check rolls are REALLY slow - Please make those faster!! || GodzillasaurusJr - Oh. This is the first gameplay video I've seen of this game. Didn't realise it wasn't a sequel to Baldur's Gate 2. Honestly, I think that's a good thing, but then I don't understand why they would take the name. :( || Radomír Frkous - It looks awesome!
But consider doing something about the blood spilling of dead bodies. The color is imo way too vivid, and the spill animation looks way too off. Maybe add a condition that it changes color based on surface it spills on. I would definitely try and discuss this with ppl from homicides department. || Jason Child - Why is the streaming quality so terrible? sound keeps breaking up? || Charalampos Koundourakis - He is so bad at the game :D || Rafael Braga - Too much cinematics and eye candy for a true BG experience :( || Tina Bean - Kudos to Larian for their founder doing a livestream game demo. He seems very involved with the development and is honest about the fact that there are still bugs and things that are being worked on. 
I love the visible dice roll mechanic and the fact that characters can receive inspiration for being played according to their alignments/background/traits... || e2- woah - Come on 30 FPS on 750 ti @ 900p || Chris Solino - It's really funny how bad at the game he is. Even knowing what's happening still messes things up lol. Can't way to play this! || George Spyros - im a huge fan of baldurs gates classic games (as well as icewind dale, etc), and anxiously awaiting BG3. However i cant shake from head how much it looks with DOS2, which i have played and i liked, but still something feels unwell. Maybe just me? || LynxAQ - Turn based has put me completely off this game... so unfortunate because BG1 and BG2 were some of my favourite games ever. But turn based is meh and tedious.. || Drew M - Meh, I wanted BG3 not Dragon Age whatever || Kavis Yao - I think it's a good game, but it's definitely not Baldur's Gate. || Krzysztof Sarna - This is DoS3 no bg3. DoS2 was fantastic so why they decided to call it bg? || Mathizsias - Archery gameplay looks hilariously cartoony. Characters without hoods and cloaks make them feel like they're just ragdolls with catsuit skins to me.. || White Wolf - Their first gameplay they released was VERY reminiscent of Divinity 2, and I didn't like that. This gameplay is obviously still based in that, but it's looking much more like a different game than a BG3 mod for Divinity 2. Really excited to play this! || Ryan Neilan - Would have loved if they went with an old school feel like BG or PoE. Should have left this as DOS3. || joaquin vega - WAIT... that... thats like ORIGINS CAMP!! || Baki Hanma - The last good D&D anything, with the way WOTC is taking the brand....

If you didn't know Orcs and Drow are racist now || Jevante smith - Larian is best boy. || Michael Howard - He's right, I don't believe him. || Oscar Banana - Only thing I may not like here is the rigid turn system. The original games ran in real time with the ability to pause to issue orders. Would much rather that than being forced to sit there and watch my party get the shit kicked out of it. It was the one thing about the Divinity games I didnt like and it sucks they kept it. || NandoViajante - Boooooring.... || Arthes Mendor - Divinity 2.5 looking good. || TempestDK - Still a lot of Divinity feel  to the assets and UI. But it does look nice indeed. I'm looking forward to trying it out. || Brad Green - About half way through.

But has there been any mention at all about the type of gear you'll collect? DOS2 gear left much to be desired || jrock 9430 - the Camera is quite a bit better than Divinity 2 || xPumaFangx - The characters emotions always seam like they are angry. No matter what was said or done. || E Z - This game looks amazing but I think heroes traveling vast distances, especially when it is climbing, just makes the environment seem much less relevant.  A rooftop ambush should be a dramatic challenge to approach and you should take incoming fire regardless of your initiative result.  Instead your heroes essentially avoid this clever ambush as easy as sprinting a sidewalk. Why not have certain terrain types impose dramatic penalties to movement speed? || Trimethicon - This looks like a slightly modded Divinity Original Sin 2. || Artyom Popov - Well, this may be a hillarious role-play game, but turn-based combat instead of real-time combat with tactical pause just ISN""T Baldur's Gate. It's Divinity with another story. That sucks. || Eazy - i remember when i was around 7-8 years old i got a job sweeping floors at the local dvd store. They never paid me with money, Instead every week i got too pick a game too take home and play. I chose Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance, me and my brother would play split screen all the time and its hands down one of my best memories from when i was younger. Although im exited for the new baldurs gate i cant help but be a little upset its not like Dark Alliance. i understand thats not what Baldurs gate was or is however thats my only memory of the game and something i enjoy a lot more then turn based games. The devs did a great job the graphics loot amazing and trailer was blizzard quality. || Diuran - Sorry but camera angle while the characters are talking is terrible - from ass point of view or some freaking leafs behind characters etc mehh. || Zippitty22 - Larian just keeps proving and proving that they are the Chosen Ones. Their games continue to be some of the best of all time. I'm sure this title will be the same, and nobody else has come close in the respective genre. Pillars of Eternity 1 & 2 are good yeah, but.... Larian's titles are on another level. || The Smail - Make Tabaxi race playable please😇 || Bratislav Metulski - its just DIVINITY III - not more! || aule - Looks a whole lot like Divinity original sin, and no it's not a bad thing, But i wished that it would at least be a bit more like baldurs gate instead. || jdkejzjzjz JEgapjgepajgz - WHERE IS THE FIGHT SYSTEM, we dont want turn based game ffs. || Xaralampos Sp. - This is divinity original sin 3,happy colourfull atmosphere and identical combat,why are you call this game baldurs gate? || Nerdy Jeremy - Why is it click to move?  We have the WASD keys for a reason!
Also, it’s weird that the camera focuses on the selected member for their response, and they never say anything.  The fact that dialogue responses aren’t voiced is  weird. || VulpesArgentum - Gish psionics,... old neckbeards will REEEEEEEEE at this. Anyways, lore wise, what’s the big deal with squids having nautiloids ships, they always have those, atleast those who roams around in Realmspace. || Marco Volpi - This <really> needs some months of polish || nemesisnick66 - whys it called baldurs gate tree if its about cthulu monsters? || What ? - Does anybody kinda do not like the turn based system? || Damir Kedmenec - BG 1 & 2 are among my all time favorites. Div. Original Sin 2 possibly one of the best RPGs of the last two decades. Love those games. Here, I don't feel atmosphere of previous BG games, and UI (pointers, icons) is almost identical to original sin games. I DO NOT LIKE IT. sorry.. || korinogaro1988 - Can we get this video in a version that was not raped and left to die by youtube compression algorithm? || Chris Brown - Still doesn't look or feel like Baldur's Gate in any way whatsoever! || asasn8or - The Mindflayers are dying of space aids || stephen gache - this doesnt really look like it plays like the original games. Kind of sad || saganist - Not quite Dragon Age 4 but looks interesting || Nick Ponomarev - Stop advertising || Orx Icx - Nice Divinity 2 DLC || Andrew Kightley - Looks promising. Will the player's character eventually be voiced (and in fact all the chosen dialogue)? The shot reverse shot of the campfire conversations really drew attention to the emotionless mannequin they are travelling with. || AaT - I don't understand why he isn't moving with all four of his characters all the time || Forrest Schreick - I don't want to be as excited about this game as I am. || K P - Spoiler alert: she's a princess.

Feels more like Dragon Age than Baldurs Gate.  BG had humor and party interplay outside of camp. || Kreamcroque - Love Larian Studio's but they shouldn't have named it Baldur's Gate 3. It just looks/feels too much like DOS with no real connection with the original two games. Just because the city plays an important part isn't enough. Something Mindflayer-like would have been better || Neocoolzero - Hope to gods we can mod our followers looks, cause that she-Grinch....hurgh || Sukesa - I hope melee is rewarded unlike Dos2 with OP teleport || YT - turn based dungeon siege. bad thing is, 3d grapichs are outdated within few years to beeing unplayable, already looks dated. also animations look clumsy, smoothness is missing. || khatack - I am incredibly disappointed that this isn't real time with pause. I hate the gameplay of Divinity: Original Sin, and don't want to see that crap in Baldur's Gate. || Rogério Penna - Looks good. But I still think they should have gone with a real time with pause with pseudoturns engine, which was like a trademark old the original BG || dash rendar - Do wounds appear on the bodies of defeated enemies? Or are overkilled enemies gonna explode like in the old Baldur’s Gate? || DarthShadow25 - I noticed that each character's health was their max hit die plus 4. Wizards 3d6 -> 18 + 4 = 22 | Cleric 3d8 -> 24 + 4 = 28 | Fighter 3d10 -> 30 + 4 = 34

This makes me really curious. At level 3, their bonus to hp should be divisable by 3, but they arent. This makes me think that health might be randomly rolled, but the fact they all fit the same formula, certainly makes that less probable. And this would also seem to imply they have the same con mod. || Victor Lawless - there it is....that half orc chick is staring straight ahead looking pissed off because she cannot speak....very irritating. || viperanaf - the turn base is driving me crazy... why couldnt they keep the original why why why? (and dont give me that bs that d&d is turn base its a PC game not a board game) || Chris King - I hate it how early the 2nd one was way better like diablo stop ruining games by changing gameplay completely || Cthulhu - You should have just made movie instead || Serenelove520 - Noooooo, I like the original isometric style!! This is not Baldur’s gate!!! || oria gruber - I'm kinda disappointed the player character doesn't talk. || stayshock - KMA RALPH....turn-based BALDUR'S FAKE 3 character.
Divinity 3 just released itself all on this title. Hope there is going to be a pause/real time version. The fighting should have that option at least. || Drayakir - Great. Instead of making a D&D 5e game, they did more Divinity: Original Sin 2. || Timothy Ritchey - Larian is what Bioware and Obsidian always aspired to be. || Sam P - I miss the old game mechanics. I hate turn based || Andrew L - Meh, it looks like another version of Divinity... Which, in turn, means they completely missed on what made BG amazing. || Psychotic Bob - Pretty game.  But I don't think I'll be playing it.  The gameplay doesn't look like something I would play longer than 30 minutes or so.  I'm used to games like Rift even though I quit that game a couple of months ago due to burnout.  But I'll continue to keep up to date as I am able. || skiamakia - divinity 2.0 || Animal crossing Is the best - Why is this actually giving me stranger things vibes...? It’s like if game of thrones and stranger things had a baby, this is what it is || Dark Roku26 - Games looks good but it’s 2020 y’all still making games where our  create characters still can’t talk in the cut scenes || Spunkmeyer Snr. - I will be avoiding this game like 'the plague' and playing through BG2 yet again. || michael Sinnhoff - The MOST impressive Baldurs Gate yet. More stunning than anything on the” screen  market since Skyrim.
Will be an immense success. An incredible leap forward,
Which systems will it be made for?
Gearing up my 80” UHD screen and making room for multiplayer action || jim - divinity original sin3 || Joe Seabreeze - Seems like Divinity with a different skin. Not a bad thing, but I think this genre needs to evolve a bit. The gameplay is great, but it's a been-there-done-that type thing. Hopefully they'll add a bit of innovation to the gameplay. || Light - what is the point of it to be Baldur's Gate 3? other than story the game is remind me of DoS2. The choices and dice check? Many people expect this game so... || Jared McClure - Why is this called Baldur's Gate 3?   It has nothing to do with the original saga, despite being based in the same world (supposedly..  that world has changed too much for it to really be the same) || Stockermann live - to bad you don't made a portuguese localization. || Kabnoot - I played Divinity Original Sin II and didnt really like it. Is this going to be any different gameplay wise from that game? I am interested but I dont really like the style of divinity, it's so boring to me. || David Tinney - Nope.. nothing like the old baldur's gates dungeon roamers.. turn based games are a thing of the past why make one now when you could make it so much greater than a board game in digital form.. || bruta - Divinity Original Sin 3 || Damien Spectre - Sucks that They went Turn Based. Baldurs gate was Real Time. || Hungarian Heroes - It isn't Baldur's Gate in any way. I'm not saying it'll be a bad game, I'm sure it'll be quite entertaining, but it isn't Baldur's Gate. No need to piggyback another classic game's fame just to lure in people. || Toothless - Looks like Divinity 2 mod
sounds like D2  mod
plays like D2 mod
and the name is ...... Baldur's Gate... 3    ??? || Capt Fussel - still dont like it..^^ want to make a full group of 6 own characters to play the story..^^and dont like the start of the actions...i mean..if u want to cast a fireball..^^ u click on button and u see the start animation in the hand of the mage...but then if u dont want to cast it?^^ which mage in real world would start a spell in that way (feels like half casted) and changes then to other^^ its just look silly if u dont cast it straight away and if u think about 2 long he stands in this pose forever^^...looks just dump...also dont like this red arrow on the ground..^^ and this 3d art dont know^^...doesnt give u such a great overview like in the old 2d baldursgate^^...also dont like the symbols and design at bottom (looks to modern), there a also a lot of ambience killers in the game... mage who says ""Eat this"" by casting and stuff..... i only like the armor and items...the conversation menues, item menue,  and the videos...think wont be my game^^ || The Jawgz - Looks too much like Divinity. I think I’ll pass. || Pius XIII. - Looks more like Neverwinter Nights than Baldurs Gate || Kyle Stewart - Wish it was 2d || Aleksandar Tasic - rly LOL ..come on guys these games were fun and good back on windows 95/98 this is not fun honestly || Xantheus07 - GOD please dont let this be woke D&D. || Brandon Erwin - Can you play this game without the turn based nonsense? || CAPCOM784 - What happened to Baulders gate?🙁 || stayshock - Why don't they steal the Diablo name and make a totally different game. Blizzard already messed that up so no one cares about that. These Larian A-HOLES are something else. Baldur's Gate was fine the way it was. God i miss Black Isle Studios. || Zach - OH SHIT, Gale was totally part of the Adventuring party that completed Descent into Avernus! || Leonardo Silva - God please give me at least Half-Orcs in the final version of the game. || Dcypherman plays - Gross but I love that Mind Flayer Ship❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ || Yutaro - 2:10 Why these mindflayers are dead? || RazorTreewise - 48:02 What do you mean I can´t adopt him ? || Thales Suzuki - Will it have coop, as divinity do? || Jose Perez - Shut up and take my money! || Cameron Larsen - i hope i can make my dnd characters || AJ Gregg - Let's go! || tgsvhe dasda - fifteenth.... :/ || Zach Brown - I'm curious about the mechanics regarding the use of bonus actions depicted here, specifically spells and potions. According to 5e rules, it is an action to drink a potion, but in this footage it is a bonus action.
Also, according to 5e rules, you can't cast a bonus action spell (such as healing word or misty step) and a leveled spell in the same turn, only a cantrip and a bonus action spell. However, that rule also seems ignored in this gameplay footage. || Skye kessel - Can you only have up to 4 characters in your party like divinty? or can you get like 5 to 6 per party? || Mobile Monster - I’m sixth || Twincast - 1:01:20 I know that D&D and its derivatives have a long tradition of misusing -th (and thou, thee, thy, and -st), but it's far from a proud one. Please don't participate in/perpetuate it, I beg of you. :| || VerdaniaMan - No modifiers? Just a flat dice roll? || Mizerable Git - Yeeeeees! || TKnightcrawler - Never trust voice-activated mics. Please. Push-to-talk. Please. But anyway, I can't wait to get my hands on this game! It looks like something I really want to play. || Alex Z - 33:43 He looks like Jesse Eisenberg || vierwhey - Im hoping they will voice the player character when the player are choosing its dialogue options. Otherwise it ruins the momentum of the cinematic between the characters with one another. || Hitman 420 - Only watched a couple minutes...i do not like turn by turn based games...never liked dragon age and it looks like they went that direction || JonezBB - This is Divinity Original Sin more than Baldur’s Gate || imurdered - This doesn’t feel like baldurs gate. This feels like divinities gate || Karimi - Dragon Age becomes a platformer. Eh. || HadesLordofDeath - Did the first two Baldur's Gate games age well? Never played and the only isometric rpg game I've played has been the first Divinity Original Sin. Planning on playing Original Sin 2 once my brother and I finish the first one. But Baldur's Gate 3 looks like a must-have whenever it comes out. || Conner Anderson - Am I the only one that doesn’t like the new narrator? I don’t mean the old dialogue but hearing the main character’s voice as something happened? || Gregor Berman - I'm sorry but this is isn't Baldur's Gate. One core element of the classic Baldur's Gate 1&2 was the combat system with party members having their own tweakable AI, if the player opts to use such a feature. This is completely dumped here, and replaced with the usual turn-based combat - and strictly turn-based it's perfectly ok, but it's not the classic Baldur's Gate way. || Jamie Katz - Larian, get the ruleset right please.
5 minutes into the battle and there were two big deviations from the 5e rules: 1- A player can't cast a bonus action spell and a level 1 or above spell in the same turn, only a cantrip. This means that misty step into thunderwave isn't normally possible 2- Goblins disengage as a bonus action so it should've done so and not provoked an attack of opportunity (unless the character had sentinel and we didn't know that) || Yaron - Looks good, I'll pass since WoTC and DnD are now embracing insane SJW policies. Good luck with that in your games full of fighting, weapons, death and murder... || Knights who say NI - Still looks and plays a lot like a divinity game. I bet my two cents that this game will be polluted with surface effect upon surface effect where npcs bombard you to Kingdom come with endless barrage of fire bombs. Therefore trash game || Jaw Belly - Looks kinda meh || doron doron - This is Divinity Original Sin 3,
but we want Baldur's Gate 3 || Cratecruncher - Why does every male character seem to be a brooding homosexual hair model.   Why does every single character have an over-the-top British accent that seems so jarringly out of place?  Is that what RPG players like?  I just started laughing at several cut scenes.  The characters just seem so hammy and overly dramatic it's funny - like a tv show for very young children. || SirRule - Anyone in the comments who wants to say, ""THiS ISn'T BalDuR's GAtE!"" Don't even talk to me... everyone else is welcome :) || John Smith - Hard pass from me. Like.... SUPER HARD PASS. 3d... turn based... that's not Baldur's Gate at all.
Reminds me of Divinity: OS more than BG... and I hated Divinity: OS. Boring as heck.
Also the whole multi level thing just makes it look like a lame puzzle game more than Baldur's Gate. || Floyd Barber - oh 3rd person view, kinda. also max 4 members in a group? that is also a let down if it stays like that.
i just have a question to the devs: what does baldurs gate3 have in common with the previous 2 ones? except the world of DND? || ReiGnJuste - Sorry but baldurs gate and turn based combat is a turn off.
Baldurs gate is known real time with pause.
Unless if they add a real time with pause combat mode!
Also let me guess there will be no cloaks || Kirmm - This is nothing like original Baldur's Gate. It's just a skinned D:OS || Music Music - Lmao lots of comments where i see "" This is why i like larian because they show bugs"" Who gives a shiz, this game looks a total and entire abomination to what baldurs gate was. Don't worry about the game, larian shows bugs in testing, top guys. || Thiago alaião - Baldur's original sin !! || evoljellyfish 00 - I hope they do not ruin this game with ""diversity and inclusion"" || Gibb - At least I did not hear Matt Mercers Voice. Thank you ODIN || Bogdan Tokaruk - Well, that's definetly not a BG game. Too bad. || D J - Feels so claustrophobic... the game is too close to the players and needs to zoom back more like older rpgs (Pillars, BG, Planescape etc). Looks too much like Divinity  artistically speaking.. Kinda hate it || Aaron Humphrey - Looks good, but doesn't look like a Baldur's Gate game at all. || CharmCitysKing - TURN BASED R U KIDDING ME!? || Mathew Chilton - It's looking even better, but please, stop trying to change how systems work and just implement them as is. There's nothing wrong with D&D's initiative system. Also you should have reactions be queued when they're able to be triggered not automatic. Enemy moves, slow or stop time and ask if you want to AoT. Someone attacks your wizard, slow or stop time and ask if you want to shield. See a lot of situations where an AoT burns a reaction then you want it for something later like shield, or cutting words. || kdhlkjhdlk - Those are some slooooow enemy turns. Might skip this one. || Hunter Feduska - The roll system is lame || Fergrew - This was heartbreaking to watch. This is not Baldurs Gate. 
This is Dragon Age for DnD. Why slap the Baldurs Gate name on this and destroy the franchise for a game that has nothing to do with the originals; which told a self contained story ended with Throne of Bhaal.
O god. The camera angles, the map design, combat flow. It is all terrible and nothing like Baldurs Gate. || Chris Riley - Please forgive me guys, but this should of been given to anyone left from Black Isle. Not given to Larian. This is not Baldur’s Gate, this is Divinity. || Mr.D L - So depressing seeing they've turned Baldurs Gate into Divinity Original Sin. It's practically identical. I get it, it's the same company, but honestly I was hoping for a different feel to the game. But if you didn't know this was Baldurs Gate you'd swear this was just a Divinity game. || seevan maroge - Ahhh yes turn based attacks. ""You go first"".
""No you go first"".
""K let's just stand here and watch eachother in awe"". || entreri12345 - Couldn't be further from Baldur's Gate if it tried. Doesn't matter though, they banked on the support from the divinity fans to drown out the criticism from the old guard. Sad stuff. || Darcek BlueEyes - This looks like Divinity add on... classic want nothing like this..shame.. this is a bit of deja vu to how Bethesda destroyed the original games franchise.well at least its a new divinity which are good games,just not Boulders gate..only ""coat"" itself as the real thing..pity. || Damian Tew - Turn based combat in 2020? Terrible. || W4tch0ut - Voice acting can elevate a great game even so much further. I'm currently playing through Pathfinder: Kingmaker and I enjoy it a lot, but it's not even close to Divinity: Original Sin 2. That game felt so much more alive because of the great voices that took part in it. I'm super excited for Baldur's Gate 3 :) || Lotrick - What's Baldur's Gate about it? It might be a good game but it doesn't remind of the originals in any way. It's more like Divine Divinity: Illithid Crusade or something. Sad! || Franz IV - Sad to see this great franchise die at the hands of these amateurs.
 DOS sucked. || hldemi - Hate those guys riding dragons. Ridiculous. In old baldur games dragons were proud creatures that would never allow anyone to ride them. || Blank - I hope Larian smartly stays away from injecting modern politics and such things into this. I want to escape reality, not be reminded of it. || Frans Fransson - Jesus this looks bad and silly .......just why turn base ....omg || America First Paleoconservative - Looks just as bad as the Divinity Original Sin 1 and 2. || Ravenbow - Horrible. Just.. no || AskBruzz DotCom - Baldur's original sin.... :( || Toney's Reviews - This isn't even BG3, lol. I don't even understand the hype. This is literally Divinity reskinned || SpreadGuts - So much cringe. How much people must have degenerated since the 90s to like this travesty that dares call it Baldur's Gate. || Владимир Калинин - Sorry for my google-english. The dialogue system is terrible, seriously. Firstly, the graphics in the approximation cause serious dissonance with how the game looks in the process. Secondly, for these games text dialogs are much better suited - you can put more information into them, and reading is simply faster than listening. || Andre Leusten - Really not a fan of turn-based combat in a Baldur's Gate game. Probably a pass for me. || Эмиль Губадов - This is not Baldur's Gate , this is X-com, I do not like . || xabun - has nothing to do with baldurs gate ... move on ..."
